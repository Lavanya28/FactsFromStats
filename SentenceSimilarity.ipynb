       "  'Amazon touted as big win for NY, but math is more complex',\n",
       "  'New York officials tout their deal to land a new Amazon headquarters as can\\'t-miss math. The city and state put up $2.8 billion in tax breaks and grants. In return, they get an economic engine expected to generate $27 billion in new tax money over a quarter-century.\\n\"This is a big moneymaker for us. Costs us nothing,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said when the agreement was announced.\\nExperts say the economic equation isn\\'t that simple.\\nThe state\\'s predicted 9-to-1 return on its investment was based on a widely used economic model that compares the costs of tax incentives with expected tax gains, but it didn\\'t factor in the substantial costs of accommodating Amazon\\'s growth in the city, economic development researchers said after reviewing the documents.\\nThe city and state will have to spend money to educate the children of Amazon workers, improve public transportation to get them to work, collect their garbage, adjust police and fire coverage, and provide all sorts of other services for a growing number of people.\\n\"Claiming 9-to-1 isn\\'t just implausible. It is a dishonest way to present the return on these incentives,\" says Nathan Jensen, a University of Texas professor of government who has been critical of the way economic development incentives are used.\\nThe reports also don\\'t measure the Amazon \"HQ2\" project against any other possible development of its intended site in the booming Long Island City neighborhood.\\nFour academic and think tank researchers who weren\\'t involved in the state\\'s cost-benefit analyses said that while its methods were standard, its scope was limited.\\n\"It\\'s a standard cost-benefit approach, but it tends to talk a lot about the benefits and not a lot about the costs,\" said Megan Randall, a research analyst at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. \"That\\'s not to say that the costs will automatically override all the benefits ... (but) cities should be armed with that knowledge.\"\\nNew York state\\'s evaluation of the Amazon deal is based on an assumption that the company will ultimately create 40,000 relatively high-paying jobs in the city by 2034. That\\'s the maximum number foreseen in a deal that starts with a promise of 25,000 jobs by 2028.\\nThe state-commissioned analysis by Regional Economic Models Inc. also predicts Amazon\\'s presence in the city will eventually create 67,000 other jobs outside the company, in industries from tech to real estate to restaurants that might serve Amazon workers.\\nOver 25 years, all those new jobs will generate about $14 billion in state income and sales taxes and about $13.5 billion in city taxes, according to that analysis and a city report also involving a REMI model.\\nCuomo lauded that as \"the highest rate of return for an economic incentive program that the state has ever offered.\"\\nREMI\\'s analysis is deep and thorough, the state\\'s economic development agency said.\\n\"Their model is widely considered to be the gold standard for economic and fiscal impact analysis and has been recognized for its analytical depth, sophistication and flexibility,\" Adam Kilduff, a spokesman for Empire State Development, said in an emailed statement.\\nA representative of the city\\'s economic development agency did not respond to questions about the analysis.\\nThe analysis may be right about tax revenue, but \"it\\'s incomplete,\" said Timothy Bartik, a senior economist at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a leading expert on incentives. \"You need to look at the spending side.\"\\nOpponents of the project have raised alarms about adding to the strain on subways, sewers and schools already struggling to keep up in the fastest-developing neighborhood in New York City.\\nSome improvements are already in the works. The Amazon agreement promises a new school and infrastructure upgrades. Critics, including some local politicians, are skeptical it will do enough.\\nThey\\'ve held a series of rallies and protests and are exploring possible options to try to stop the project.\\nWhile voters in New York City support bringing Amazon\\'s campus to the city, they are divided when it comes to the incentives from the city and state, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.\\nThe survey, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, found that 57 percent of city voters support Amazon\\'s decision, while 26 oppose it. Forty-six percent of respondents support the incentives, however, compared with 44 percent who said they are opposed.\\nBeyond the costs of growth, the New York analyses also don\\'t address some other questions, experts said.\\nDavid Merriman, a University of Illinois at Chicago public administration professor who specializes in tax issues, said it didn\\'t consider the possibility of economic growth in Queens even if Amazon never came.\\nThere were prior plans for big commercial and residential development on part of the potential Amazon site that have now been scuttled in favor of accommodating the company.\\nThe state analysis also didn\\'t examine whether New York could have bagged the same prize while offering less, as Virginia did to score an additional Amazon headquarters there.\\n\"A proper analysis would take seriously that we are uncertain how much, exactly, was needed to attract HQ2 to New York,\" said UT\\'s Jensen.\\nAmazon officials have said \"the driving factor\" in choosing New York and Virginia was the availability of enough tech talent, not the tax incentives.\\nDespite the unanswered questions, Bartik argues the financial bottom line isn\\'t necessarily the point.\\n\"I honestly don\\'t think that the main thing that people should be looking at is whether or not it makes money for the state government. That\\'s not the purpose of state government,\" he said. \"The bigger impact is if you create jobs that otherwise wouldn\\'t be there.\"'],\n",

       "  'Leaders of Gulf Arab countries, including those boycotting Qatar, met on Sunday in Saudi Arabia\\'s capital for a regional summit, a gathering that Qatar\\'s ruling emir choose not to attend amid the dispute.\\nThe absence of Qatar\\'s Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, as well as Qatar\\'s recent decision to withdraw from the Saudi-dominated OPEC oil cartel, underlined the simmering crisis facing the Gulf Cooperation Council.\\nDespite mediation efforts by Kuwait, the gap remains between others in the six-nation GCC, an alliance formed in 1981 in part to offer a counterbalance to Iran, and Qatar — countries that are all American allies. The United States, which under President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, also has been unable to mend relations even as it wants a unified front for its high-pressure campaign targeting Tehran.\\nSaudi King Salman greeted GCC leaders Sunday as they descended down a golden escalator at a Riyadh air base and never mentioned Qatar in his remarks to the summit. The king instead spoke about the need to counter Iran, as well as the kingdom\\'s ongoing war in Yemen.\\n\"Extremist and terrorist powers continue to threaten our security in the Gulf and in the Arab world,\" the king said. \"The Iranian regime is continuing its hostile policies and continues to intervene in other nations\\' internal affairs.\"\\nIran\\'s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif later tweeted that the \"region has had far too many strongmen who have only caused war & misery.\"\\n\"What we need is a stronger REGION rather than strongmen,\" Zarif wrote, apparently in response to the GCC meeting.\\nKing Salman\\'s son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, sat prominently behind his father during the summit. His high-profile appearance came despite him being linked to the slaying and dismembering of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents in October in Istanbul.\\nKuwait\\'s ruler, the 89-year-old Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, did discuss Qatar, warning of internal divisions threatening the GCC and urging its members to stop a \"media war.\"\\n\"The most serious challenge we are facing is the Gulf dispute and its continuation which is now causing a serious threat to our unity and affecting our citizens\\' interests,\" Sheikh Sabah said. \"This has also caused the rest of the world to look at us as an entity with cracks forming in its unity, and that we can no longer guarantee the interests of other nations as we could when our unity was stronger.\"\\nQatar\\'s Sheikh Tamim sent Sultan bin Saad al-Muraikhi, minister of state for foreign affairs, to represent the country. Al-Muraikhi offered no comments during the open session of the GCC meeting. The sheikh had attended last year\\'s GCC meeting in Kuwait, where nations boycotting Qatar sent lower-level representatives.\\nBahrain\\'s Foreign Minister Khalid Al Khalifa tweeted that Sheikh Tamim should have \"been there at the summit.\"\\nIn June 2017, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties to Qatar. They also launched an economic boycott, stopping Qatar Airways flights from using their airspace, closing the country\\'s sole land border with Saudi Arabia and blocking its ships from using their ports.\\nThey say the crisis stems from Qatar\\'s support for extremist groups in the region, charges denied by Doha. The four nations also have pointed to Qatar\\'s close relationship with Iran. Qatar restored full diplomatic ties to Iran amid the dispute.\\nQatar\\'s natural gas reserves have made the Arabian Peninsula country fantastically wealthy, sparking its successful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatar also hosts the al-Udeid Air Base, the home of the forward headquarters of the U.S. military\\'s Central Command and about 10,000 U.S. troops.\\nThe U.S. deputy assistant secretary for Arabian Gulf affairs, Timothy Lenderking, said Washington wants to see Gulf unity and ties with Qatar repaired soon.\\n\"GCC unity\\'s been a really important pillar for U.S. engagement with this region, with the Gulf, with the Middle East. We\\'d like to see that unity restored,\" he said on the sideline of a security summit on Yemen in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.\\n\"It\\'s important not only for the GCC to be a strong bulwark against Iranian influence in the Arabian Peninsula but also to allow us to capitalize on economic linkages that can add development to the region and that can help the countries bind together,\" he said.\\n———\\nAssociated Press writers Aya Batrawy and Fay Abuelgasim in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.']]"
