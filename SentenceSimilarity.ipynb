       "  'Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) Six people have been arrested after a teenage boy died in an adulthood initiation ritual that went wrong in Kenya.\\n\\nJuliano Kanyonyo, 15, died Wednesday morning after being sent to a camp to join other teenage boys in a traditional ceremony designed to teach him the customary values of his people.\\n\\nDays after returning from the trip and recovering from a circumcision that is part of the ritual, Kanyonyo was found dead by his sister at their home in Kandara, central Kenya.\\n\\n\"I went to serve him tea, we are not allowed in that house as females but he would pick it from outside but that morning he did not wake up, his sister Lucy Njoki told CNN.\\n\\n\"I left until mother came and we peeped to see him lying on the floor with foam on his mouth,\" Njoki said.\\n\\nRead More\\n\\nMassive 5,000-year-old burial monument unearthed in Kenya Area police commander Wilson Kosgei called the teenager\\'s case \"extreme\" and said he went through a \"serious assault.\" Kosgei told CNN: \"Usually in the Kikuyu tradition, we are told bullying does take place to harden the boys, but this case is extreme, as the postmortem results showed that this boy went through a serious assault, he could have been hit on the head with an iron or something like that.\" \"It is very sad and we are doing everything we can to bring to justice the people involved. So far we have arrested, the mentor and six other boys, we are treating them as suspects,\" Kosgei added. The commander told CNN the suspects will be arraigned in court this week. CNN has been unable to reach them for comment. In many Kenyan communities, once a boy hits puberty he is initiated into manhood through circumcision. Families send their sons to the initiation ceremonies during the school holidays where boys are circumcised and trained to be men. The boys, usually aged between 13 and 15 go through harsh treatment to prove their manhood, including being beaten by others to show their pain threshold and endurance. Follow CNN Africa on social media Read the latest news from Africa and share your thoughts with us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Kosgei added that the police work closely with community leaders and said he is not aware of any other cases where a boy has died during an initiation ceremony. Kanyonyo belongs to the Kikuyu, Kenya\\'s most populous ethnic group. According to Kikuyu tradition, the first phase for a man is birth, followed by initiation, marriage, then death. A typical initiation process lasts around 14 days and women are not allowed to be present or have sight of the area where the ritual is held. His family told CNN that he had just received his national examinations results which would allow him to attend the high school of his choice. \"He wanted to go to Mangu national school and become a neurosurgeon, his dream has been cut short now,\" said Njoki.'],\n",

Hide Caption 6 of 6 President Joseph Kabila announced in August that he won\\'t seek a third term, following speculating that he would bypass the country\\'s two-term limit. His second term ended in 2016 but he refused to step down and tried to change the Constitution. Deadly protests ensued. Democratic Republic of Congo\\'s President Joseph Kabila Kabila has ruled since his father\\'s assassination in 2001. He nominated his Interior Minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary as his successor. Shadary\\'s main challengers from the fractured opposition are businessman Martin Fayulu of the Lakuma coalition and the well-known leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, Felix Tshisekedi. Violence threatens Ebola response Deadly violence has hampered efforts to stamp an Ebola outbreak scourging the country\\'s northeast, posing additional challenges to the already dire humanitarian situation. Health workers operate within an Ebola safety zone in the Health Center in Iyonda, near Mbandaka, DRC in June. At least 231 people have died from the deadly virus in the country\\'s heavily populated northern region, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, according to DRC\\'s Ministry of Health . More than 350 cases have been confirmed in North Kivu province, where the epicenter is, and neighboring Ituri province. Fighting between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas. Earlier this month an armed group attacked UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni, in North Kivu province. Earlier in the week, at least seven peacekeepers were killed and 10 others were wounded in clashes with militias. The World Health Organization has warned that the movement of more than 1 million people through the provinces could further spread the deadly virus.'],\n",
