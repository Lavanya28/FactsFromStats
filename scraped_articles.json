The support via the Fund includes pro-bono consultancy, strategic direction and CNN airtime and inventory.\n\nRani Raad said: \u201cCNN has been a leader in the Travel and Tourism sector for many years, working with over 100 countries on nation branding and destination campaigns that go well beyond traditional advertising. We are proud to use this unique position and the expertise we have developed over these years to give back to the sector and help countries such as Guatemala recover from disaster and tell their story to the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to collaborate with CNN, a longstanding UNWTO partner and critical voice for global tourism development, to support crisis recovery through tourism. Travelling to a destination after a crisis provides important support towards its recovery, and Guatemala is a richly rewarding destination worthy of such support. We send best wishes to Guatemala as it works hard to restore its tourism sector and advance sustainable development,\u201d added UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili.\n\n\u201cThe eruption of the Fuego volcano was of great proportions and affected a specific geographic area of our country. Therefore, in the tourism sector we had an intervention strategy, whose main objective was to minimise the impact on the arrival of national and foreign visitors. Our communication strategy was based on key messages that indicated that the best way to support Guatemala was by visiting it. Also, that the tourist destinations were in appropriate conditions and that they were ready to receive visitors,\u201d said the Minister of Tourism of Guatemala, Jorge Mario Chaj\u00f3n. \u201cWe are honoured to have been selected to be the first country to receive CNN\u2019s \u2018Go There Media Fund\u2019. We are certain that the economic activity that will most help the economic reactivation of the country is tourism. Thank you for joining us in strengthening and encouraging it\u201d.\n\nThe \u2018Go There Media Fund\u2019 is the latest step in CNN\u2019s far-reaching commitment to the Travel and Tourism sector. Over the last decade, CNN\u2019s specialist CNN TASK (Tourism Advertising Solutions Knowledge) Group has worked directly with over 100 countries around the world to create impactful and strategic communications solutions for destinations, hotels, airlines, high profile events and other critical sector role players. This has led to many award-winning campaigns from CNNIC\u2019s branded content studio, Create, and a close partnership with the UNWTO.\n\nElsewhere at World Travel Market this week, CNN\u2019s Richard Quest chairs the Ministers\u2019 Summit on the morning of Tuesday 6 November; CNN will broadcast live from WTM at various points; CNNIC is shortlisted in the International Travel & Tourism Awards for its My Choice, Naturally campaign for Costa Rica; and delegates can experience CNN, CNN Travel, CNN VR and Great Big Story content first-hand at a CNN activation space next to the Asia and Italy Halls.\n\nAbout CNN International Commercial\n\nCNN International Commercial (CNNIC) is the division of Turner International responsible for the business operations of CNN\u2019s properties outside of the United States.

During a speech last year, he promised that the \"severed inter-Korean railway will be connected again,\" adding that one day, \"a train departing from Busan and Mokpo will run through Pyongyang and Beijing, and head towards Russia and Europe.\"\n\nSouth Korea sent rail cars and dozens of officials to North Korea on Friday for joint surveys on northern railway sections the countries hope someday to connect with the South.\n\nRead More\n\nInspection tour A seven-car train left Seoul Station at 6:30 a.m. local time Friday, arriving at the border two and a half hours later. After nukes and summits, can Kim Jong Un reform North Korea's economy? Proceeding slowly and carefully, inspectors are hoping to ascertain the state of the North Korean railways, and just how much money would be required to upgrade them to the point they could carry South Korean trains. According to South Korean officials, North Korea has over 5,226 kilometers (3,247 miles) of railway, compared to about 3,900 kilometers (2,423 miles) in the South. However, most of the North Korean routes operate as single track lines (meaning trains cannot pass each other) with an average speed of 40-50 km per hour (24-31 mph). South Korea's Korail estimated in 2012 the total cost of repairing the railways in North Korea at $210 million for the eastern line and $96 million for the western line, though these figures may have since grown due to ongoing lack of repair and the effect of sanctions. The trip will be the first time a South Korean train car has ever traveled along the North's eastern Donghae line from Mount Kumgang to the Tumen River. South Korean inspectors previously visited the North in 2007, to examine the Sinuiju to Kaesong section of the tracks, during a period of rapprochement. The new trip will travel from Kaesong to Sinuiju near the border with China, down to Pyongyang, Wonsan and Anbyon before a trip to the Tumen River and a final return via Wonsan, Pyongyang and Kaesong to Seoul. Im Jong-il, chief of the joint survey team, was also part of the 2007 inspection, which was carried out in the bitter Korean winter. \"(It was) very cold. As we rode the train, we had to conduct our survey while occasionally dodging the train coming from the opposite direction, which was difficult,\" he told reporters. At least this time, the train is heated throughout, so inspectors can focus on looking at the tracks, rather than focusing on keeping warm. \"The team members are experts in this field so they will be able to tell aging by plain sight for the most parts. The result will depend on how much the North Korean officials will show us,\" Im said. The state of the North Korean rail system is currently unclear, but may take significant upgrades before it could support regular traffic from the South. Sanctions headache But while the two Koreas are steaming ahead in building stronger ties, the North remains subject to stringent international sanctions passed in response to its nuclear and missile testing. The Trump administration has also expressed caution at the prospect of South Korea pushing ahead with inter-Korean projects, maintaining that sanctions provide an important diplomatic tool in holding the North accountable. The team had to receive special permission from the United Nations to carry out the visit, and are under strict instructions to bring any leftover materials back to Seoul with them. The last time South Korean inspectors visited North Korean train stations was in 2007. The sanctions have created a number of problems for the South Korean inspectors, who had to bring their own food, water and fuel, lest they breach sanctions by purchasing any from the North. The inspection team is also wary of the health risks posed by drinking or eating North Korean products. \"At last survey (in 2007) there was a lot of bellyache. So we are bringing lots of water,\" project manager Ji Yong-tae said. A pool reporter who went on board the train before it departed said there were hundreds of bottles of water stacked in one of the compartments, adjacent to the two-meter-long sleeping pods where the inspectors will live for the next few weeks.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/asia/north-south-korea-train-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "She exposed Duterte's drug war, now she faces prison in the Philippines", "text": "(CNN) Images and stories from Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's brutal war on drugs have shocked audiences worldwide, as bodies have stacked up in cities across the country, many of them victims of extrajudicial and vigilante killings.\n\nWhile the government has hardly been shy about its intention to go after both dealers and users, hard data on the number of killings has often been tough to come by. One indispensable source of information, both for the international media and readers in the Philippines has been the upstart news site Rappler, which is now facing a reckoning with the government it has been a dogged check upon.\n\nRappler CEO Maria Ressa is due to land in Manila this weekend, when supporters fear she could be arrested, after she and her company were formally indicted on multiple counts of tax evasion this week , charges critics say are politically motivated and designed to silence independent media in the southeast Asian country.\n\nThe formal accusations bring with them a potential 10-year prison penalty under Philippines tax law.\n\nShocking images like this one have become a common sight due to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's two-year \"drug war.\"\n\n'Ridiculous'\n\nIn January, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily revoked Rappler's registration on the basis that it had violated the country's constitution over foreign ownership rules.\n\nPhilippines officials claim Rappler and Ressa failed to declare about $3 million in 2015 on tax returns from an investment by the Omidyar Network, a fund created by eBay founder and philanthropist Pierre Omidyar.\n\nAt the time , the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called the charges a \"direct assault on freedom of the press.\" The rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, claimed it was \"an alarming attempt to silence independent journalism.\"\n\nRessa, an award-winning journalist who previously served as a CNN bureau chief in Manila, has defended Rappler's ownership structure as \"100% Filipino,\" and maintained the charges against her company are politically motivated.\n\n\"I've long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.' The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities. I am definitely not a stockbroker,\" Ressa told CNN Thursday, after news of the charges broke.\n\nShawn Crispin, CPJ Southeast Asia representative, said the charges were a \"blatant form of legal harassment and underline President Rodrigo Duterte's desperate attempt to stifle its critical reporting on his government.\"\n\nDuterte's office has denied he is involved in the prosecutions against Rappler, but the President has previously sparred with the company's employees, personally barring Ressa and reporter Pia Ranada from Malacanang Palace, his official residence, over their coverage of his administration\n\nBrad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said the case sent \"a chilling message to journalists and human rights activists (in the Philippines) that they will be targeted for exposing his murderous campaign.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Rappler CEO: Stripping of license is political Replay More Videos ...

That figure is the official police count, however, and opposition lawmakers and rights groups estimate the true death toll could be in the tens of thousands.\n\nThose killed have included children and innocents, as well as ordinary drug users and criminals executed extrajudicially.\n\nAmong Philippines media, Rappler in particular has focused on the human toll of the drug war, and often contested the official death counts put out by the government under the social media campaign #RealNumbersPH, a self-described effort to counter what it calls a \"false narrative\" on the war on drugs.\n\nThis has attracted criticism from both supporters of the President and Duterte himself, who has long had an uneasy relationship with the press since before he was elected in a landslide in May 2016\n\nAhead of his inauguration, Duterte defended the notoriously high fatality rate for journalists working in the Philippines as sometimes justified and accused the media of being corrupt.\n\n\"Just because you're a journalist you are not exempted from assassination, if you're a son of a bitch,\" Duterte said in comments that were swiftly denounced by press groups. \"Freedom of expression cannot help you if you have done something wrong.\"\n\nAs many as 12 journalists were killed in the first two years of the Duterte administration, higher than under any other president during a similar period, according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP).\n\nIn the latest Press Freedom Index, the Philippines fell six places to 134th of 180 countries, with the report's authors warning that the \"dynamism of the media has ... been checked by the emergence of a leader who wants to show he is all powerful.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED This man compares himself to Hitler Replay More Videos ...

These people are targeting anyone who attacks, who asks questions about the drug war. The drug war began in July of 2016. It's targeting journalists. It's targeting anyone who's perceived to be critical of President Duterte. Those attacks are heinous. It brings out the worst of human nature.\"\n\nWhile Facebook has come under intense scrutiny for its role in spreading disinformation in the US and Europe, the social network has also been roundly criticized for not doing enough to police its platform in Asia, with both Facebook and its subsidiary WhatsApp accused of allowing hateful and dangerous content to be shared in countries such as Myanmar and India\n\nRessa was overseas when the charges against Rappler were first announced, but she has vowed to return to the Philippines and fight them, even if that means doing so from a prison cell.\n\n\"In many ways the government's attacks against Rappler have made it very clear to us exactly who we are, what our identity is, and for our young reporters who are on the ground, how clear and necessary our mission is today,\" Ressa told CNN last month.\n\n\"Our democracy is in transition ... the mission of journalism has never been needed as much as it is now, and we'll continue doing these stories.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/asia/maria-ressa-philippines-duterte-media-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Drop charges against news site Rappler, Human Rights Watch says", "text": "(CNN) Human Rights Watch has called on Philippine authorities to drop criminal charges against the news website Rappler and its editor, Maria Ressa, criticizing the legal action against them as politically motivated.\n\nThe international rights watchdog accused the government of using tax laws \"to muzzle prominent critics of President Rodrigo Duterte and his 'war on drugs.'\"\n\nRappler said five cases were formally filed against Ressa and Rappler Holdings in two courts.

Journalists who have covered the Duterte's anti-drug campaign critically have reported harassment and intimidation. Human Rights Watch said he and other senior administration officials have \"denounced, threatened, and demonized journalists.\" \"As Duterte has imposed an increasingly authoritarian rule, he has shown unrelenting hostility to Rappler and other critical Filipino media that are a check on his abuse of power,\" Adams said. \"The Philippines' allies and friends should denounce these attacks and support efforts to defend press freedom and human rights in the country.\" Ressa told CNN on Thursday, after news of the charges against her emerged, that she had \"long run out of synonyms for the word 'ridiculous.'\" \"The basis of this case is that Rappler is classified as a dealer in securities.

When you see great focus on the F-35 from Japan I think that is the result of the very strong US-Japan military partnership,\" the source told CNN.\n\n'Push the front line of maritime engagement'\n\nSources said the new Japanese-US deal would include two of the three F-35 variants, the A and B models. The third, the F-35C, is designed for use on the US Navy's largest aircraft carriers.\n\nF-35As, of which Japan already has 10 in its fleet, with 32 more on an preexisting order, are conventional jets, using a runway to take off and land.\n\nF-35Bs are short take-off and vertical landing capable, meaning they can use smaller airports or operate from flattop warships. The US Marine Corps flies F-35Bs off US Navy amphibious assault ships, sometimes called baby aircraft carriers as they are about half the size of the US Navy's Nimitz-class carriers.\n\nJapan's Maritime Self Defense Force possesses two of these type of ships, the Izumo and its sister ship, the Kaga, each one is capable of carrying 14 helicopters and would need to be refitted to accommodate the F-35Bs aircraft.\n\nThe Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force ship JS Izumo sails the South China Sea with the US guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey.\n\nWhile the main role of Japan's military remains defense of its home islands, \"this could push the front line of maritime engagement further out than before,\" said Corey Wallace, Asia security analyst at Freie University in Berlin, said of Japan's possible acquisition of F-35Bs.\n\n\"Will it bother China? Probably, but only in so far that it further complicates the projection of Chinese military power into the southwestern maritime domain around Japan's Ryukyu islands,\" Wallace said.\n\nAn article published in the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper, Wednesday, said the refit of the Izumo-class ships, and the purchase of the F-35Bs, \"essentially changes the warships' nature from a defensive to offensive one.\"\n\nThe story continued: \"Japan must not forget its infamous history of invading countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region during WWII.\"\n\nChina's own answer to the F-35, the domestically built twin-engine J-20 stealth jet, entered the People's Liberation Army Air Force fleet in February. It is unknown how many J-20's China has in operation in its fleet at present.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and now Hawaii Pacific University professor, said the F-35Bs on a Japanese warship \"add a new dimension\" and \"a deterrent factor\" to the security situation in the Pacific.\n\nBut Schuster said a refitted Japanese carrier would likely only carry six to eight F-35Bs, compared to as many as two dozen jets that will be on Chinese carriers now in sea trials or production.\n\nSchuster also cautions that it could be three or four years until newly ordered F-35s reach the Japanese fleet, unless Tokyo's orders are given priority over other buyers of the plane.\n\nThe Japanese Air Self-Defense Force maintainers pose for a photo during the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nTwelve nations besides Japan and the US are in the F-35 program, with two of those -- Australia and South Korea -- in the Pacific region, according to Lockheed Martin, which builds the plane.\n\nJapan does enjoy the advantage of being one of three final assembly points for the F-35, the others being in Texas and Italy.\n\nAnd it's the F-35 commonality between Japan, the US and their allies that brings strength in numbers but also understanding.\n\nWallace said the future could conceivably have US F-35s operating from Japanese ships and or Japanese F-35s flying off American ones.\n\nOne of the other two nations to operate the F-35B, the United Kingdom, has had US versions of the jet operating off its HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier.\n\nBut Wallace also warned not to overemphasize the importance of a Japanese carrier.\n\n\"This singular new carrier won't carry enough planes, or be able to launch jets with enough ordnance to conduct strike, or bombing missions in any way that will truly threaten China's mainland, given how strong China's own defenses are,\" he said.\n\nWhat F-35Bs will do is increase the options available to Japanese defense planners.\n\n\"The F-35B can operate from modified runways or make-shift airfields thereby giving Japan's Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF) more options to operate from smaller, more distant Japanese islands in a pinch. This is quite important for survivability and response if the major airbases are put out of commission in a saturation missile attack,\" he said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/asia/japan-f-35-fighter-aircraft-carrier-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "US calls for release of young Americans trapped in China ahead of G20", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Ahead of a high stakes meeting between Chinese and US leaders at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires, a top US security official has demanded the release of two young Americans who say they've been prevented from leaving China.\n\nVictor and Cynthia Liu, aged 19 and 27, and their mother, Sandra Han, are believed to have been refused permission by Beijing authorities to leave China, where they have been held since June.\n\nUS authorities told CNN they are working closely with the two Liu children who are reportedly being used to pressure their father, Liu Changming, a high-profile Chinese fugitive, into returning to Beijing where he is wanted for financial crimes.\n\nOn Tuesday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton became the most high-profile US figure to comment the case, with a post on Twitter declaring: \"These Americans need to be allowed to return home.\"\n\nVictor and Cynthia Liu\n\nEven though Victor Liu was born in the US and both Liu children hold a US passport, Beijing views them as citizens of China and subject to its jurisdiction.

Thirty seconds after that he reported that they had experienced a \"flight control problem,\" the report said.\n\nAfter the aircraft's flaps retracted following takeoff, the automatic trim problem noted on the previous night's flight returned, until the flight data recorder stopped recording when the plane crashed.\n\nThe report said the pilots on the plane's penultimate flight reported that instruments were showing inaccurate readouts from the angle-of-attack (AoA) sensors.\n\nThe report said that the plane was \"automatically trimming\" on the previous flight -- that is, the computer was adjusting the aircraft's angle -- so the pilots switched to manual trim and, as their safety checklists didn't recommend an emergency landing, they continued to Jakarta.\n\nFurther maintenance on the AoA sensor was carried out in Jakarta prior to Flight 610's takeoff the next morning. After the flight took off, the instruments recorded a substantial discrepancy in the aircraft's angle -- as much as 20 degrees.\n\nAviation expert Geoffrey Thomas called the report \"very comprehensive\" and said that he could not understand why Lion Air had deemed the plane suitable for service.\n\n\"Clearly the plane had serious sensor issues ... why the airplane wasn't pulled out of service beggars belief,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"Tinkering around and replacing parts isn't enough.\"\n\nAs part of the continued investigation, the faulty AoA sensor will undergo further testing, the NTSC said.

He was loved by everybody in his company.\"\n\nShe says her son, Capt. Bhavye Suneja told her there was no updated training simulation session when Lion Air started using the new aircraft.\n\n\"They said it was not required... When the transition happened, he said, 'Mama, I'm going to fly the MAX.' I said, 'How can you do that (when) you don't have (a) simulator session?' He said, 'We don't need to.'\"\n\nComing from an aviation family, she said that Suneja's sister wanted to follow in his footsteps, but that the fatal accident had shaken her faith in the technology.\n\n\"Even my daughter wants to be a pilot. She was so inspired by him she also wants to be a pilot,\" she said.\n\n\"Now I have apprehensions. I don't know. How safe it is. The trust in the machine is shaky now.\"\n\nShe added that air safety regulation across the world needed to be re-established to reaffirm people's trust in air travel.\n\n\"Whenever they (present new aircraft) to the market, where the life of the people is at stake, the regulators must re-establish three, or five, levels of crosscheck...

Faith, fury and fear: The story behind one of history's greatest mass migrations Even as the Indian cabinet approved the building of the corridor, Delhi on Wednesday dismissed the resumption of bilateral talks. Earlier, Pakistan invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend a regional summit in Pakistan next year. Responding to Pakistan's invitation, Modi's foreign minister, Sushma Swaraj rejected the idea of talks. \"Bilateral dialogue and the Kartarpur corridor are two different things,\" said Swaraj at a press conference in Hyderabad. \"The moment Pakistan stops terrorist activities in India, the dialogue can start.\" The long and winding road The Sikh temple -- also known as a Gurdwara -- of Darbar Sahib is considered holy by the Sikh community. The Gurdwara was home to Guru Nanak Dev, one of the leaders of the faith for 18 years and he died there in 1539. Sikhs from India have traveled to Pakistan to pay homage at the shrine for years but the trip is a difficult one to make due to a contentious relationship and security concerns. The corridor will enable devotees to travel from the border town of Gurdaspur and across the international border into Pakistan without visas. The inauguration of the corridor on the Indian side took place Monday and Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan is scheduled to inaugurate construction at the Pakistani end later today. Setbacks to talks Over the years, multiple attempts have been made by both administrations to reconcile and restart bilateral talks. Back in 2014, Modi invited then Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony and later visited him in Pakistan on his birthday in December, 2015. But a terrorist attack on an Indian military installation in September 2016 that Delhi blamed on what it said were Pakistan-linked terrorists overshadowed these efforts. Pakistan denied any role in the attack.

A hiker discovered the mass stranding of as many as 145 pilot whales.

Days later, the fishermen -- who have since been arrested for facilitating his trip -- say they saw the tribespeople dragging his body around the island.\n\n\"We want to avoid direct confrontation with the tribespeople,\" Dependra Pathak, director general of police of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, told CNN when asked about the latest efforts to retrieve Chau's body. \"We do not want to go there and create an unhappy situation.\"\n\nThe decision to avoid a direct confrontation with the isolated tribe came after a series of meetings and reconnaissance trips made by the officials.

We'll firm up a plan very soon,\" said Pathak. The Sentinelese: World's most isolated tribe The Sentinelese have lived in complete isolation on the remote North Sentinel Island for tens of thousands of years. The island, which is part of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands territory, is roughly as large as Manhattan. India has protected the island for decades to prevent the Sentinelese from contracting modern illnesses and to keep outsiders safe. People are not allowed to go within five nautical miles of the island by Indian law and the Indian Navy patrols it day and night. And while its residents have no contact with the outside world, they aren't too far from other civilizations. The island is only about 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Port Blair, the territory's capital known to tourists for its stunning emerald beaches, history and water sports. At least 15 Sentinelese could be living on the island, according to India's census estimates from 2011. John Allen Chau was an avid aventure traveler. He returned to his boat twice before vanishing Traveling on a tourist visa, Chau arrived at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in October with one mission: preach to the Sentinelese. Indian authorities say Chau was 27, but Mat Staver, founder of a Christian ministry that Chau was involved with as a college student, gave Chau's age as 26. He had traveled to the remote island years ago and returned knowing that his mission was illegal and risky. Still, he wanted to get to know the islanders' way of life. He hoped to eventually share the gospel and perhaps translate the Bible, said a friend, John Middleton Ramsey. He asked a local friend, an electronic engineer, to get a boat and also recruit others -- several fishermen and a water sports expert -- who could help him. He carefully planned his expedition and used a 13-page long journal to write his strategy, the steps he would take to reach the island and, later, some of his memories. After he paid the fishermen around $350, police said, the group boarded \"a wooded boat fitted with motors\" and headed to the island on the night of November 15. They stopped a little less than half a mile away and waited in the dark. At some point in the morning, Chau \"used a canoe to reach the shore of the island,\" Pathak said. He returned later that day with arrow injuries, police said. But that did not discourage him. He returned to the island the following day. It's unclear what happened but \"the (tribespeople) broke his canoe\" and he had no other option than to swim back to the boat. On the third attempt of his mission, he didn't come back. The fishermen said they later saw the tribespeople dragging his body around but police haven't been able to independently verify Chau's death. Authorities believe he was killed.

It's slurpable and versatile, with endless combinations that make it taste new every time. You can eat bun with fish sauce or tomato broth, snails or grilled meats, wrapped in a spring roll, or woven into mini-b\u00fan blankets of joy in the form of banh hoi.\n\n\"What I love about the variety of Vietnamese noodle dishes is that while they may have some crossovers in ingredients and herbs, they often have totally different compositions, and certain ingredients that truly make each noodle dish special,\" Mark Wiens, a \"full time travel eater\" who runs the Migrationology food travel blog, tells CNN.\n\nBroth basics\n\nOf course, all noodle dishes aren't created equal. According to Helen Le, the host of Helen's Recipes on YouTube, the best way to judge a noodle dish is by examining and tasting the broth and fish sauce.\n\n\"The best broth is clear -- (in Vietnam), we don't like cloudy broth s ,\" says Le.\n\nThe clearer it is, the better the balance of flavors -- salty, sweet, sour and bitter -- which is essential to a good dish. Ready to slurp some soup? Here are five dishes that showcase the best of Vietnam's bun noodles and where to try it in Hanoi, the capital city:\n\n1. B\u00fan ri\u00eau\n\nThe first thing you'll notice about B\u00fan ri\u00eau -- a meat or seafood vermicelli soup -- is its red hue. Dan Tham\n\nB\u00fan ri\u00eau is a meat or seafood vermicelli soup with a distinctive crimson color. The broth gets its appearance from tomato paste and annatto oil, made from achiote tree seeds.\n\nFreshwater crabmeat and blanched tomatoes are the soup's star players. Tamarind paste lends sourness to the broth, while airy bits of fried tofu contribute crunch.\n\nDepending on the region, b\u00fan ri\u00eau might also come topped with beef, pork, snails or fish. Vermicelli noodles swim in the soup, adding balance to a dish that's both colorful and light. Add to that the requisite plateful of lime wedges, chili and greens -- like banana blossoms and mint -- and you have a perfect meal.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: B\u00fan ri\u00eau street stall run by Ms. Thu, located in Th\u1ecd X\u01b0\u01a1ng Alley, near St. Joseph's Cathedral\n\n2. B\u00fan ch\u1ea3\n\nA cold noodle dish, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 features hunks of charcoal-grilled fatty pork. Dan Tham\n\nB\u00fan ch\u1ea3 is a local lunchtime obsession in Hanoi. A cold noodle dish, b\u00fan ch\u1ea3 features hunks of charcoal-grilled fatty pork -- cha -- bathing in a blend of the ubiquitous fish sauce, vinegar, lime and sugar.\n\nVermicelli noodles, fruits and veggies, such as carrots and green papaya, accompany the glorious pork.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: B\u00fan ch\u1ea3 C\u1eeda \u0110\u00f4ng, 41 C\u1eeda \u0110\u00f4ng Street, Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District; +84 90 458 1964\n\n3. B\u00fan c\u00e1 H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng\n\nOne of the most popular dishes in Haiphong is b\u00fan c\u00e1, literally meaning \"fish noodles.\" Dan Tham\n\nOn the way to the Pandora-like islands of Ha Long Bay, you'll pass Hai Phong, one of Vietnam's most important seaports and, by extension, one of the best places in the country for seafood.\n\nBun ca Hai Phong, literally \"fish noodles of Hai Phong,\" is much subtler than other, more flamboyant Vietnamese dishes.\n\n\"It's the contrast of textures that makes this dish interesting,\" says Le.\n\nThe fish -- usually mackerel, carp, or catfish -- is pounded into fishcakes then deep-fried. Traces of dill, tomatoes, green onions and perilla -- a mint-like herb -- combine for a light meal.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: An Bi\u00ean, 111 Tri\u1ec7u Vi\u1ec7t V\u01b0\u01a1ng in Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng District; +84 4 3974 0571\n\n4. Ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1\n\nCh\u1ea3 c\u00e1 brings together vermicelli noodles with turmeric-spiced catfish. Dan Tham\n\nMore than a century old, Cha Ca La Vong restaurant is so good an entire street in Hanoi is named after it.\n\nThe humble two-story cafe is famous for its ch\u1ea3 c\u00e1: chunky cuts of tender grilled catfish, or basa, that's been yellowed by turmeric and seasoned with dill and shrimp paste.\n\nCh\u1ea3 c\u00e1 arrives in a small pan atop a portable gas stove accompanied by bountiful garnishes, chopped peanuts and cold noodles. Like most great eating experiences, cha ca is a do-it-yourself process. As the fish fries on the stove, diners can cook up the fresh green onion, ginger and extra dill. The flavor combination is fresh, yet earthy; delicate, yet pungent.\n\nWhere to try it in Hanoi: Ch\u1ea3 C\u00e1 L\u00e3 V\u1ecdng, 14 Ch\u1ea3 C\u00e1 in Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm District; +84 4 3825 3929\n\nRelated content Find out what's new with Hanoi street food\n\n5.

Dan Tham\n\nB\u00fan b\u00f2 translates to \"Southern-style beef noodle,\" but you can still find this particular type of noodle soup in the northern city of Hanoi. The best place to try it?

From people sipping and sitting on low plastic stools on the sidewalk while gossiping with friends, to those who prefer the pricier, hipster-style cafes popping up around Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, the need for caffeine is inescapable.\n\nEveryone at Hanoi's humble Cafe Giang however, is after something more than just a caffeine fix. They've come for \"c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u00fang,\" or egg coffee, a Hanoi specialty in which a creamy soft, meringue-like egg white foam is perched on dense Vietnamese coffee.\n\nWhile destinations across the city now serve it, this cafe claims to have invented it.\n\nThere are hot and cold versions. The former is served as a a yellow concoction in a small glass. It's consumed with a spoon and tastes almost like a coffee flavored ice cream -- more like a dessert than coffee.\n\nThe hot version comes resting in a small dish of hot water to maintain its temperature. The strong coffee taste at the bottom of the cup seeps through the egg -- the yellow layer on top -- and is quite thick and sweet, though not sickly.\n\nl e v a r t\n\nA family secret\n\nCafe Giang is packed on both levels and in the center of the premises, at the bridge between the lower and upper levels, sits Nguyen Van Dao, keeping track of the plentiful orders in a large notebook and giving orders to those serving.\n\nBehind him, there's a modest, open-plan kitchen where a modern, red mixing machine is whirring constantly, whisking up eggs and other parts of the recipe. Van Dao visibly swells with pride when asked about the cafe's most famous drink.\n\nHe says it was his father, Nguyen Van Giang who invented the recipe while working as a bartender at the Sofitel Legend Metropole Hotel in 1946. At the time, there was a shortage of fresh milk in the country so whisked egg yolk was used as a substitute.\n\n\"All the foreigners and the Vietnamese in the hotel liked it,\" says Van Dao. \"So he decided to leave the hotel to start selling egg coffee and create his own brand.\"\n\nWhen pushed on the recipe Van Dao begins listing the ingredients while counting on his fingers.\n\n\"Egg, condensed milk, coffee powder, some butter, some cheese... but I can't tell you everything, it's a secret recipe\" he chuckles.\n\n'I've never had a client not like it'\n\nMark Lowerson, who runs Street Eats Hanoi, takes tourists from all over the globe on food tours and says egg coffee always goes down well.\n\n\"For the vast majority of our clients, the egg coffee experience is a revelation\" he says. \"The wow factor is high. When I start describing it, they can't put two and two together. 'Egg' and 'coffee', together? It's pretty hard to get a coherent image of those two ingredients in a cup together. It's always fun.\n\n\"I've never had a client not like it. Most devour it and swear they're coming back for one every day they're in Hanoi. Even people who are not normally coffee drinkers can be surprised.\n\nThat said, he admits some people find it too rich to finish. \"It is a very decadent way to get a caffeine hit, let's face it.\"\n\nVietnamese coffee culture\n\nInfluenced by the Chinese, who ruled the country for 1,000 years, traditionally Vietnam was a tea-drinking nation.\n\nSo what makes coffee so popular today?\n\nRelated content Vietnam by motorcycle: History and culture on two wheels\n\n\"I can't really answer that with complete confidence, but I do believe it started with French influence, which makes sense given the popularity of bread and cheese,\" says Will Frith, a specialty coffee consultant who has worked n in Dalat in the central highlands of Vietnam.\n\n\"The French introduced coffee to Vietnam, mainly as a way to supply their own colonial expat populations. As Vietnam became influenced by other economic forces and collaborators from Europe -- the French in 1860s through the early 20th century and the Germans mid-century, which opened them up to instant coffee production -- coffee started to make its way into cities, where popularity has increased ever since.\"\n\nNowadays coffee culture is very much entwined in Vietnamese life.\n\n\"The older generation prefer to sit at sidewalk cafes, smoke cigarettes and socialize,\" explains Frith. \"Many will sip on coffee all day long. The younger generation is into the more European-influenced cafe experience, going out to be seen in cafes and to socialize with friends. Many of these cafes are decorated like discotheques, with loud club music to match.\"\n\nAs for some of the new coffee trends in Vietnam, Frith says there's a growing interest in all things natural and specialty.\n\n\"Hand-crafted goods, elegant presentation and novel experiences are sought after and specialty cafes are popping up all over Ho Chi Minh City, with other cities also starting to see a little activity in this segment,\" he says.\n\n\"Anything mixed or blended with milk and sugar will find an enthusiastic audience.\" Something that Cafe Giang's Van Dao knows all too well.\n\n\"I feel very honored and happy to have so many tourists come here and know our brand,\" he says, motioning to his packed cafe full of both locals and tourists.\n\nSo what makes his egg coffee stand out from the others offering the same drink across the capital?\n\n\"The difference is in the recipe,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Many others have tried to copy it but the taste is just not the same.\"\n\nOther Hanoi cafes to get an egg coffee fix\n\nDinh Cafe\n\nOwned by Mr Van Dao's sister, this is perhaps the second best place in Hanoi to savor some c\u00e0 ph\u00ea tr\u00fang and features views of Hoan Kiem lake.\n\n13 Dinh Tien Hoang, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 3824 2960\n\nOriberry Coffee\n\nSelling Fair Trade coffee by utilizing farmers co-operatives from regions throughout Vietnam to provide poor farmers with better working conditions and incomes, Oriberry has two locations in the city.\n\n25 Xuan Dieu, Tay Ho, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 6275 8669\n\n36 Au trieu, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)4 6275 8669\n\nLeu Coffee\n\nQuirkily decorated, this cafe/bar with an underground vibe draws mostly a local crowd and serves great coffee and drinks.\n\n2nd Floor, No.1, Ta Hien Street, Hoan Kiem, Hanoi; +84 (0)98 453 03 82\n\nLoading T\n\nSet in a gorgeous colonial mansion, Loading T is perhaps one of the most charming spots to grab a cup of coffee in the city.

Most villagers try to buy new clothes, but few can afford gold, jewelry or elaborate gifts.\n\nThe annual dates of Diwali are as fluid as types of revelry you'll find. It's generally celebrated for five days, with the biggest day being the third one.\n\nIn 2018, northern India marks that day on Wednesday, November 7. However, it falls on Tuesday, November 6, in southern India, where it's called Deepavali.\n\nHere's a look at some of the most popular ways to celebrate.\n\nCommon traditions\n\nSome Diwali rituals are common across most of the subcontinent.\n\nIn both city and countryside, small oil lamps made of clay (diyas) are placed at the thresholds of homes, shops and offices throughout the five-day affair to celebrate the legend of the return of the Hindu god, Lord Rama, to his kingdom after 14 years in exile. According to mythology, his people lit diyas to welcome his return.\n\nIn villages, the rangolis are sometimes drawn on top of fresh cow dung. AFP/Getty Images\n\nHindus in cities and villages also believe that during Diwali the Hindu goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, will visit their homes if they are lit, clean and beautifully decorated.\n\nWindows and doors are left open to let the goddess in, and homes are cleaned from top to bottom.\n\nBrightly colored rangolis are drawn using fingers on the ground at the entrances to homes and offices. These geometric designs are usually symbols of nature. Their purpose is to welcome guests and to encourage Lakshmi inside.\n\nRelated content 6 things you should know about Diwali\n\nGambling card games are often played in villages and cities, as it is generally considered auspicious to gamble during Diwali.\n\nThis springs from a legend that a Hindu deity played a dice game with his consort on the fourth day of Diwali and she won. Some Hindus believe Lakshmi can be invoked through gambling.\n\nPlace your bets\n\nGambling parties are an especially popular pastime during Diwali in Mumbai. The parties typically start at 10 p.m. in bungalows and farmhouses and continue until 5 a.m.\n\n\"People don't mind losing -- it's part of the ambiance and people are having fun,\" says Vikram Mehta, founder of Red Om Entertainment in Mumbai. \"Everyone dresses up, everyone is on holiday, everyone is inviting each other to their homes, there is a lot of warmth.\"\n\nVarious games are played. The most popular is Teen Patti (three-card brag), and blackjack and poker are also favorites.\n\n\"People sit on mattresses on the floor. There are rooms where the kids play for fun and then other rooms with the higher stakes,\" Mehta says. The houses are decorated with diyas, people dress in traditional Indian dress, servants wander around with platters of kebabs, biryani and Indian sweets, he adds.\n\nAcross the country, Indian sweets -- known as mithai -- are exchanged and people have large family gatherings in their homes.\n\nNew year, new accounts\n\nDiwali marks the start of the new Hindu financial year and many businesses open new accounts books. AFP/Getty Images\n\nDiwali also marks the start of the new Hindu financial year, and many businessmen, traders and shopkeepers open new account books. Business people in certain states, particularly Gujarat, worship their account books.\n\nThere are various other rituals celebrated in towns and villages on each of the five days. For example, on the last day of Diwali in many parts of India, a sister cooks for her brother and he bestows gifts on her in celebration of the love between siblings.\n\n\"The modern world is changing, and festivals are the only way to keep our culture and traditions alive. For us, Diwali is the victory of good over evil, the returning of good back into our lives and starting a new year with a positive approach and forgetting all the bad that has happened,\" says Mumbai housewife Heena Damle.\n\n\"You have tables ready with sweets to offer if someone comes to your home,\" adds her nephew Pranav Damle.\n\nLighting up the night\n\nTypically firecrackers are set off from dusk, often throughout the night. The noise is believed to herald the defeat of evil and catch the attention of the gods.\n\nRag picker Santosh, whose family migrated from a Maharashtrian village to Mumbai, says: \"People in the villages have limited means, so it's not very spectacular. In Mumbai, the rich celebrate it with a lot of pomp. We witness huge fireworks and can get such fancy crackers.\"\n\nSome, however, are concerned that the original traditions of Diwali are being lost in cities.\n\nInir Pinheiro is managing director of Grassroutes , which promotes responsible village tourism, and takes urban Indians on trips to tribal villages. He says many of them want to \"see an unadulterated way of celebrating Diwali, a less noisy place and to reconnect with the people.\"\n\n\"I think people in the cities are beginning to realize there is a lot of show in the way it is celebrated and a large materialistic aspect to it. People want to see if there is something more to the celebration,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nRelated content India's 30 most beautiful places\n\nHopes for the harvest\n\nIn the 500-person village of Purushwadi in Maharashtra, families of five typically live in stone houses of two bedrooms. Dutta Kondar, a farmer from the Mahadeo Koli tribe, says that Diwali is a \"celebration of the end of the harvest of kharif (rain-fed crops).\"\n\nSince harvest is when the villagers make money, villagers carry out Lakshmi puja (prayer ritual) on their assets at Diwali, giving thanks and praying for a good harvest to come.\n\n\"We conduct a small puja of our cattle, grain and cash,\" Kondar says. Family members hold a plate of offerings to the gods and chant prayers while rotating the plate around the assets, he explains.\n\n\"To make sure our bodies are prepared for the winter, we eat lots of oil and sweets,\" Kondar adds.\n\n\"Whenever anyone enters their house, the villagers offer each other sweets. But they don't buy presents for each other -- money being a big constraint,\" Pinheiro says.\n\nVillage values\n\nLike many rural villages across India, Purushwadi has its own particular rituals. Pinheiro says one of the most popular is the local singing ceremony.\n\n\"This is when children go round the houses holding hand-made lanterns made of sticks and twigs and they sing Marathi songs for the benefit of residents of the homes.

They hold a unique place in the national imagination, having been used by samurais, nobles and martial artists alike.\n\nBut long after the abolition of the samurai class (and the outlawing of public weapon-carrying), the artisans' ancient production techniques live on. Shimojima specializes in a historic style of sword known as mamori katana -- a lucky charm that can protect its owner from illness and misfortune.\n\nShimojima may take a month to produce a single sword, with more complex additions able to take production time to more than a year. Credit: Detouur.com\n\n\"In today's society, there is not much use for a katana as a weapon,\" he says. \"As a swordsmith, I find joy in creating a product that supports the mental and spiritual needs of the client, and one that can be handed down family generations for hundreds of years.\n\n\"Swords have been an integral part of Japanese tradition since the ancient times, and I believe a katana serves as an essential base for the traits and behaviors of Japanese people today.\"\n\nAncient techniques\n\nKatanas were first produced over 1,000 years ago, and are distinguished by an upward-facing cutting edge that allows users to draw and strike in a single motion. Their role in Japanese society has changed dramatically since then, though the production process remains largely the same.\n\nThe blades are forged from tamahagane, a steel whose layers contain differing amounts of carbon. Shimojima painstakingly heats, softens and then folds the steel in order to remove impurities and even out the carbon content.\n\n\"A single layer becomes two layers, then two become four, four become eight and so on,\" he explains. \"By folding 15 times, over 32,000 layers are produced. However, it does not mean that the more layers, the better. There's of course a limit, and if you exceed the limit you lose ... the strength required to serve as a sword.\"\n\nNext, the sword is shaped -- although it begins completely straight. As the steel is hardened through a process of repeated heating and cooling, the differing densities in the blade's structure create its signature curve.\n\n\"In the space of 10 minutes, we heat up the blade to about 800 degrees centigrade and rapidly cool it down in water,\" Shimojima says. \"It seems like a simple process. However... it's a matter of making a split-second judgment.\n\n\"One mistake can often lead to a total failure -- a fatal mistake,\" he adds.\n\nShimojima's traditional techniques differ little from those used by Japanese swordsmiths for centuries. Credit: Detouur.com\n\nThe resulting blade should demonstrate a balance of strength, flexibility and durability. Shimojima's workshop may take a month to produce a single sword, with more complex additions (like mountings and hand guards) sometimes taking production time to over a year.\n\nTradition in decline\n\nDespite the katana's storied past, the trade is in steady decline. In the late 1980s, the Japanese Swordsmith Association reported around 300 members among its ranks. That number has reportedly dwindled by almost half in the years since.\n\nAcquiring mastery is laborious, and apprenticeships take years to complete and are often unpaid.\n\nSworsmiths harden steel through a process of repeated heating and cooling. Credit: Detouur.com\n\nFor Shimojima, it was the swords' timeless appeal that first attracted him when, as a junior high school student, he came across an 800-year-old katana at the Tokyo National Museum. Struck by its flawlessness, it was an encounter that led him to peruse a career in sword making.\n\n\"Throughout its history, (the craft) has been passed down over generations without ever changing its shape, its stance, its values or its meaning,\" he says.\n\n\"The fact that (old katanas) have not been covered in rust, nor have they begun to decay, proves their quality. Therefore, we must spare no effort, even for the (swords') unnoticeable parts.\n\n\"I do not believe that Japanese swords themselves will disappear from this world,\" he adds. \"Good-quality katanas from the old days will always survive and be remembered.\"\n\nThe swords must undergo an extensive polishing process that can take weeks to complete. Credit: Detouur.com\n\nModern production techniques pose a further threat to the profession, allowing manufacturers to make similar items quickly and inexpensively -- in neighboring China, especially. They are, however, no substitute for the real thing.\n\n\"Every step of its production process, as well as the reasons behind it, are all for its practical use, and its beauty comes as a result of that,\" Shimojima says of his traditional techniques. \"I believe the beauty of a Japanese katana lies within its simplicity -- its aesthetics without any unnecessary elements.\n\n\"Functional, yet with a hidden elegance.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/fusahiro-shimojima-samurai-swordsmith/index.html", "published": "2018-10-16T11:18:31+00:00"}, {"title": "Japanese artist reimagines masterpieces", "text": "Written by Oliver Giles, CNN\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\" is one of the world's most reproduced and reinterpreted paintings -- but no one has done it quite like Japanese artist Keita Sagaki.\n\nFrom a distance, Sagaki's replica looks like a pen-and-ink version of the original. But a closer inspection reveals that the picture is composed from hundreds of tiny cartoon characters. A drawing of a dog lies along the Mona Lisa's cheekbone, while a smiling cat sits on the end of her nose. A cartoon of the planet Saturn can be found floating on her forehead.\n\nSome of the characters might look familiar to fans of Japanese anime and manga. But while all of the cartoons in his works are technically original, Sagaki admits that he is heavily inspired by artists and collectives like Osamu Tezuka, Fuji Fujiko and Studio Ghibli.\n\nHigh and low, East and West\n\nThe \"Mona Lisa\" isn't the only Old Master painting that Sagaki has reproduced using manga-inspired characters -- he has also created his own versions of Leonardo's \"The Last Supper,\" Botticelli's \"The Birth of Venus\" and Hokusai's \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa,\" among others.\n\nDetail shot shows Sagaki's version of \"The Great Wave off Kanagawa.\" Credit: Keita Sagaki\n\nHe began reproducing famous artworks in his distinctive style back in 2004, seeing it as an interesting way to combine Western art with the manga and anime characters he'd loved as a child.\n\n\"Western paintings and Japanese art contain many conflicting concepts,\" Sagaki explained in an email interview. \"Western paintings offer depth, while my characters are flat. Even in many classical Japanese paintings, perspective is not used much.\"\n\nThis fusion of Western masterpieces with Japanese pop culture has won Sagaki fans all over the world, with his art appearing in exhibitions as far afield as Germany and Portugal. He's currently preparing for an exhibition at Hong Kong's Fabrik Gallery in March, where he'll unveil new works based on Baroque paintings. Among them are reproductions of \"Boy with a Basket of Fruit\" by Caravaggio, \"Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window\" by Johannes Vermeer and \"A Woman Bathing in a Stream\" by Rembrandt.\n\nThe show's curator, Jason Sveinn, believes that the appeal of Sagaki's drawings lies partly in the way they treat manga and anime as serious art forms.\n\n\"Sagaki actually dreamed of being a manga artist drawing cartoons when he was a kid,\" Sveinn said in a phone interview. \"He used to draw cartoons in his notepad, and he thought to himself, 'Maybe I should do something interesting with this; maybe I can apply this technique to works that I can see in a museum.'\"\n\nThe mind of Takashi Murakami\n\nSpiritual undertones\n\nSagaki doesn't produce drafts of his artworks. Instead, he draws directly onto paper using a 0.015-inch black pen, referring to images of the painting that he's reproducing. Sagaki's drawings vary in scale, from roughly the size of a sheet of A4 paper to enormous works almost 10 feet wide. Given that a single mistake could ruin an entire work, Sagaki takes his time when drawing, and some works take as long as a year to complete.\n\n\"Sagaki is an example of a true Japanese artist,\" Sveinn said. \"What I mean by this is that he secludes himself in his studio, quietly and patiently drawing. He's incredibly focused.\"\n\nKeita Sagaki sees his distinctive style as an interesting way to combine Western art with the manga and anime characters he loved as a child. Credit: Keita Sagaki\n\nThis approach is partly inspired by an interest in Buddhism, Sagaki said. One of his earliest memories is visiting the Toga Meiso no Sato meditation center in Japan's Toyama prefecture, where several mandalas (intricate, richly colored Buddhist paintings representing the cosmos) were on display. As with Sagaki's art, mandalas are composed of tiny individual parts that combine to create a whole image.\n\n\"My style and mandalas have some things in common,\" Sagaki explained. \"First of all, they are very detailed depictions. And in the creation process, drawing, for me, is like meditation. That is exactly how mandalas were created.\"\n\nYet, Sagaki's inspiration is also deeply rooted in the Western tradition. When deciding which masterpiece to reproduce, he uses a strict set of criteria -- most importantly, that the painting has to be famous.\n\n\"A picture that everyone knows gives rise to a big 'gap' between looking from far away when it appears to be a straightforward reproduction,\" he said, \"and looking closer when the anime detail becomes clear.\"\n\nSagaki also chooses paintings that feature stark contrasts, so that he can vary the density of his anime characters. But despite the apparent accuracy of his reproductions, Sagaki admits that he often recreates Old Master paintings without ever seeing them first-hand.\n\n\"I saw the original beforehand for about half of my works,\" he said. \"But after I've created my work, I want to see them. I went to see the 'Mona Lisa.'\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/keita-sagaki-masterpieces-manga/index.html", "published": "2018-02-16T00:43:34+00:00"}, {"title": "The many faces of Japan's 'expressionless' Noh masks", "text": "Written by Stella Ko, CNN Contributors Yoko Wakatsuki, CNN\n\nTheir almond-shaped eyes stare blankly into space. The ambivalent corners of their mouths leave their moods utterly indiscernible.\n\nThese wooden masks, used in an ancient form of Japanese theater called Noh, were made to be expressionless. But performers are charged with using slight and subtle movements to reveal the hidden emotions carved into each one.\n\nDating back almost 1,000 years, Noh is a style of musical drama with plots ranging from Japanese legends to modern-day events. Its masks, carved from blocks of cypress, are a key part of the tradition, representing figures like demons and monks. Actors are able to portray their characters' feelings by changing the angle and orientation of their heads.\n\n'Humans try to hide their emotions'\n\nEighty-year-old Toshiro Morita has been photographing various forms of classical theater and theater masks since 1964. Coming from a family of photographers, he has published more than 20 books on Noh and the dance-drama tradition of Kabuki.\n\nIn his small suburban apartment he showed CNN hundreds of negatives taken over the past five decades. Most of his pictures were taken using a film camera, and aside from those published in books, haven't been digitized.\n\nUsing only natural light, Morita photographs Noh masks in front of a simple black background. Given their lack of expression, the slightest change in perspective and lighting can bring out a multitude of new emotions.\n\nHe prefers to hold his camera, instead of using a tripod, allowing him to easily adjust the angle -- and therefore the mood -- of his shots.\n\n\"Humans try to hide their emotions,\" Morita said. \"But masks don't tell you anything (so) I can depict what I want.\"\n\nA third-generation photographer, Morita grew up watching various types of theater, and was inspired by his father and grandfather's images of Japanese stage arts. After experimenting with surrealist oil paintings, he decided to continue the family tradition after graduating from art university.\n\nHistorically, mask making was not a profession in its own right. Performers would instead ask local carpenters to create custom masks featuring unique, neutral expressions.\n\nMasks carved from blocks of cypress are a key part of the Noh tradition, representing figures like demons and monks. Credit: Toshiro Morita\n\nAccording to Morita, it was important for mask makers to have a relationship with the wood they gave life to. But the craft has changed in recent years.\n\n\"That's why older masks have a lot of variation,\" Morita said. \"But there is no originality in modern masks. They are just copying historic ones.\n\n\"A Noh mask is the face of an actor and can never be parted (from it). Actors puts them on inside the dressing room and the performance starts from there. Most people only see the performance on stage, but actors are already immersed in their roles from when they first face the mirror.\"\n\nThe importance of masks\n\nWith roots going back to the 12th century, Noh developed from ancient ceremonial dramas performed at shrines and temples.\n\nBut, like many traditional performing arts, Noh is struggling to attract interest in modern Japan. The Nohgaku Performer's Association, an organization representing Noh actors, told CNN that its membership has dropped almost 20% in the last 10 years.\n\nIn 2001, Noh was named a \"Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity\" by UNESCO, with some of the top practitioners now labeled \"Intangible Cultural Assets\" by the Japanese Government.\n\nAmong them is Noh actor and mask carver Michishige Udaka, who founded the International Noh Institute in 1986. As well as publicizing and preserving the theater's traditions, Michishige is committed to discovering a generation of new performers.\n\n\"I come from a family deeply rooted in the tradition of Noh,\" he said. \"I felt honored to be part of that family, and I renewed my vow to maintain the tradition of my ancestors.\n\nHaving performed Noh since the age of 6, Michishige has a lifelong understanding of the subtle movements required to communicate with audiences. By tilting the mask up, for instance, actors appear to be smiling or laughing, while tilting downwards can express sadness or frowning. Performers may also use props likes fans, covering parts of their face to demonstrate shyness.\n\nPhoto shows Udaka Michishige in the play Nonomiya.

Credit: Photo by Fabio Massimo Fioravanti\n\n\"Noh masks are not mere props but the face of living human beings,\" Michishige said.\n\nA self proclaimed fan of Morita's pictures, Michishige describes the photographer's work as \"very special.\"\n\n\"I think he sees between the real world and the world of emotions,\" Michishige said.\n\n\"He shows his understanding in his photographs. He can find those gray nuances.

The 110-foot long structure, an oblique concrete slab that looks like a sunken periscope, was submerged in July 2018 and work is now underway to complete the interiors, in anticipation of the public opening in spring 2019.\n\nWhen finished, the structure will accommodate about 100 guests with a total internal area of about 500 square meters (5,300 square feet) set over three levels, offering unique underwater views of the surrounding marine environment through a 11-meter (36 feet) wide panoramic window.\n\nUnder goes under\n\nThe restaurant was built in about six months on a barge near the coast, then towed into position -- about 600 feet away -- with a heavy-lift vessel. To submerge the structure, containers filled with water were placed inside, before securing it to the sea floor with a total of 18 anchoring points.\n\n\"It was a delicate operation, as the clearance to meet the bolts was just two inches,\" Rune Grasdal, a senior architect at Sn\u00f8hetta, said in a phone interview.\n\nMore than half of the structure is submerged, and guests will gain access through a glass walkway that will bridge the gap between the coast and the entrance, which will be at shore level.\n\nUnder is made of reinforced concrete, to withstand the harsh conditions found in this spot of the Norwegian coastline. \"The first problem is water pressure, as we're five meters (16 feet) below the surface, but the biggest challenge is the waves. Wind and waves are extreme here. To withstand all these forces, the building is slightly curved, so it can better take to the waves, and it's thick: half a meter (1.6 feet) for the concrete and about 30 centimeters (1 foot) for the acrylic windows,\" said Grasdal.\n\nA simple design\n\nThe decision to position the restaurant in an area battered by the elements was deliberate. \"When the client came to us, they had already done some sketches on another site close to current one, but we convinced them to build a few hundred meters away, where the sea is actually rougher. We thought this would better capture the nature of the area and I think that's also what makes this more spectacular compared to other underwater restaurants in the world, as they are in very controlled areas,\" said Grasdal.\n\nA handmade, floating hotel\n\nThe client, developers Gaute and Stig Ubostad, also operates a hotel a short distance from the restaurant. They both sit in the Lindesnes region, home to Norway's oldest lighthouse , a popular tourist attraction located at the southernmost tip of of the mainland. Getting here isn't too easy: the best way is to hop on a short flight from Oslo to Kristiansand, the closest airport, which is about an hour's drive away. Grasdal said that a boat service is in the works.\n\nThe design of the structure was also subject to several revisions. \"Initially, we spent a lot of time on very complicated designs, but after a long discussion and many different models we ended up doing things in a much simpler way. It's just a concrete tube that brings people from the land down to the sea, it's so simple. When we reached that conclusion, it was a actually relief,\" said Grasdal.\n\nA light touch\n\nTo guarantee the safety of the guests, an analysis has been performed to study the propagation and load of the waves, and the 2,500-ton structure is designed to withstand the most extreme events. The data will also be fed back to visiting research teams that study marine biology and fish behavior. Work has been done to restore the conditions that were in place prior to the disturbance created by submerging the structure, and the concrete shell is designed to invite mussels to cling onto it and blend into the surrounding nature.\n\nThe tasting menu, created by Danish head chef Nicolai Ellitsgaard Pedersen, is still under wraps but will rely heavily on local seafood, although mushrooms, berries, various seabirds and wild sheep from the surrounding landscape will also be on offer\n\nFrom the main window in the dining area, which is 4 meters (13 feet) tall, guests will be able to observe a variety of fish and sea creatures including seals and lobsters. Crucial to this view is the lighting, which has been carefully designed for both the interior and the sandbank just outside. \"Outside lighting is very important because in the wintertime and in the evenings it will be dark, and without any light you would just see the reflection of the restaurant on the window,\" said Grasdal.\n\nInterior lighting is muted and discreet to avoid such reflections, and colors are chosen accordingly, with oak wood and fabric covering the walls to avoid glaring white spots.\n\n\"It's a magic feeling to be down in a big room like this and see out into the sea through the huge window And what's surprising is that some of the renderings we did illustrate very closely what it's going to be like,\" said Grasdal.\n\nThe restaurant is accepting reservations starting in April 2019, although availability is already limited well into the summer. According to Grasdal, however, the best way to plan a visit is looking at the weather forecast. \"I think the most exciting experience will be visiting the restaurant during rough weather,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be fantastic to see the sea surface broken up by the big waves and the rain, making for a very dramatic view -- although you will still feel safe and relaxed inside the restaurant.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/snohetta-underwater-restaurant-construction/index.html", "published": "2018-10-02T04:05:09+00:00"}, {"title": "Nikunotoriko, Tokyo's 'prehistoric' restaurant", "text": "Written by Oscar Holland, CNN\n\nTokyo's buzzing Roppongi district is a picture of neon-lit modernity, where glistening skyscrapers stand amid designer boutiques and late-night bars.

This reckless act will leave your face as red as the dish.\n\nLee Kang-sun Silbijip, founded over 45 years ago, has four spiciness levels.\n\nThe restaurant is in the Mugyo-dong district in Jongno-gu. The area has been synonymous with the classic spicy dish since the '60s and '70s.\n\nSocial heat: If you're willing to let your companion see you during this meal -- with your red face and belly bulging with liquids you drank to dilute the spice -- it's true friendship.\n\nHave your stomach suffer at:\n\nLee Kang-soon Silbijip, 75-1, Cheonggyecheon-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul; +82 2 737 7880\n\n2. Jjambbong (Seafood noodles)\n\nSpice rating: 4/5\n\nThe first thing you're told when you sit down for jjambbong (a ridiculously hot seafood-based noodle dish) is to eat the noodles first.\n\nOnce you hit the broth, infused with four different chilies from Korea, China, Vietnam and India, the fire becomes too fierce to put out through standard means.\n\nOne mouthful of noodles is enough to cause acute pain on the tongue.\n\nAdd a spoonful of broth and your entire head may feel that it's been set on fire.\n\nThe version served at Shingildong Spicy Jjambbong is immensely rich.\n\nI found myself dabbling dangerously into the soup and noodles even as I experienced gut-wrenching pain.\n\nA sign in the restaurant politely requests customers to use the restaurant's bathroom if they feel the need to throw up, rather than purge themselves on the street.\n\nThe stack of milk cartons in front of the famed noodle shop is testament to the satanic levels of spice inside.\n\nSocial heat: Expect some bonding over the noodles as you watch each other wince and writhe in pain.\n\nIf you need to make amends with colleagues at work, invite them out for a team-building experience.\n\nCry for your mama at:\n\nShingildong Spicy Jjambbong, 10-1, 62 Road, Singil-dong, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul; +82 10 5395 1151\n\n1. Onnuriye Donkatsu (Pork cutlet)\n\nThose who finish the Drop-Dead Donkatsu inside 20 minutes get their face on the Wall of Fame. Jiyeon Lee /CNN\n\nSpice rating: 5/5\n\nThe innocent restaurant name, Onnuriye Donkatsu (\"Pork Cutlet Around the World\"), is deceiving.\n\nThis place is actually known for serving the Donkatsu of Death, aka the Drop-Dead Donkatsu, by far the spiciest dish I've ever endured.\n\nThe pork cutlet is drenched in an ominous dark red sauce made from a rich broth of Asian herbs and what owner Song Jung-won claims is the spiciest chili on earth.\n\nSong keeps the recipe for his over-the-top sauce a close secret.\n\n\"I want to make it the utmost difficult challenge for only 0.1 percent of the population,\" he says.\n\n\"There's something about the spiciness that draws people to it even though they're in pain. They usually think 'how spicy could it possibly be?'\"\n\nOne thumb-sized slice of the donkatsu was enough to make me give up.\n\nThe restaurant dares diners to eat the Drop-Dead Donkatsu within 20 minutes, but be warned: They won't serve the dish unless you bring a carton of milk with you.\n\nThe brave few -- and they are few -- who complete the challenge get their face on the Wall of Fame.\n\nSocial heat: There won't be any conversation after a bite of this dish.

Just as you are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol when you haven't eaten, spice can attack an empty stomach.\n\nPrepare the right drink. When it comes to alleviating the pain of spicy food, water is no help. It only rolls the spice around in your mouth and momentarily relieves the pain.\n\nMilk or other dairy drinks help take the heat out of your mouth and also comfort your burning stomach.\n\nPlan ahead. The effects of spicy food can linger long after actual consumption.\n\nEmbarking on a spice challenge when you have an important meeting, exam or travel plans coming up is not a bright idea. You never quite know when the afterburn will kick in.\n\nPick the right companion. Spicy food can cripple your social skills.\n\nYou're not exactly charming when your eyes are watering, you're blowing your nose every three seconds and the only sound you can produce is a groan of pain.\n\nConsume heat only with friends who understand that sometimes we all need a good cry.\n\nDon't be overly ambitious. Or proud. Yes, everyone will be impressed with your ability to eat the chilies straight out of the kung pao bowl ... for about five minutes. But you've got to live with that scorched stomach for the rest of your life.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/korea-spicy-dishes/index.html", "published": "2015-08-21T00:49:45+00:00"}, {"title": "Tongyeong: 8 things to see at South Korea's seaside escape", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 The city of Tongyeong, located on the southern coast of South Korea , is a popular weekend destination year-round.\n\nIts lures? Fresh seafood, picturesque seascapes and quaint fishing village charm.\n\nPart of the Hallyeohaesang National Park, this hilly city serves as a base for exploring the nearby islands. It's easily reached by express bus -- a four-hour ride from Seoul or an hour from Busan , South Korea's second-largest city.\n\nShowing off the pristine coastal charms of South Korea, it's the perfect place to kick off an island-hopping journey. Here are eight things to see when you travel to Tongyeong:\n\n1. Gangguan Port\n\nMost of Tongyeong's traditional markets, restaurants and shops are located in and around Gangguan Port. Dusk is a great time to take in the lively vibe of this fishing port.\n\nOnce the sun starts to go down, the evening lights illuminate the area and nearby fish markets and restaurants come alive to prepare for the dinner rush.\n\n2. Traditional fish markets\n\nFor the freshest catch of the day head to Jungang Traditional Market, located across the street from Gangguan Port. It's lined with stalls that kick things off in the afternoon and stay busy well into the evening. You can pick out your own fish, which will be cleaned on the spot.\n\nFor a small fee, diners can grab a table nearby and enjoy a traditional Korean raw fish meal. The price includes a spread of condiments, such as dipping sauces, and greens for vegetable wraps.\n\nFor early risers, Seoho Traditional Market is bustling at dawn. This is the place to enjoy shirakguk, a hearty radish leaf soup and rice eaten by local fishermen and fishmongers for breakfast.\n\nYou'll find fresh fish at both markets, although the smaller Seoho Market has a bigger selection of dried seafood.\n\n3. Dongpirang Village\n\nDongpirang: A village saved by art. Shin Kim\n\nWhen this hillside working-class village behind the Jungang Traditional Market was marked for demolition back in 2007, art students were commissioned to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThis village was soon filled with beautiful wall murals -- too beautiful to tear down.\n\nRelated content South Korea's most beautiful places will leave breathless\n\nIt's since become hugely popular and is packed with tourists on weekends. The tight alleyways are filled with colorful, quirky murals, sculptures and art studios. There are cozy cafes at the top of the village offering views of Gangguan Port.\n\nKorean drama fan? The village was used as a set in \"Padam Padam\" and \"The Innocent Man.\"\n\n4. Mireuksan Mountain\n\nFor a stunning 360-degree view of Tongyeong and Hallyeohaesang National Park, which is dotted with islets, take a 10-minute cable car ride up to the top of Mireuksan Mountain . There are different viewing points.\n\nDuring summer, it's a popular destination to take in the area's golden sunsets. After you return to the foot of Mireuksan Mountain, it's worth visiting Donghwasa Temple.\n\nOriginally built in 632, it was reconstructed several times in the 19th century after being destroyed by avalanche and fire.\n\n5. Jeon Hyuck Lim Museum of Art\n\nTongyeong is home to some of South Korea's most famous contemporary artists, including novelist Pak Kyongni, poet Yu Chi-hwan and composer Isang Yun.\n\nFrom the foot of Mireuksan Mountain, a five-minute walk takes you to the private art museum of painter Jeon Hyuck Lim (1916-2010), a celebrated Tongyeong artist referred to as \"magician of colors, painter of the sea.\"\n\nThe museum was built on the grounds of the painter's house, where he lived for 30 years. It's covered in 7,500 ceramic tiles featuring motifs of works by Jeon Hyuck Lim and his son.\n\n6. Island hopping -- on foot?\n\nTo truly appreciate the beauty of Hallyeohaesang National Park's marine ecosystem, visit one of the nearby islands.\n\nSomaemuldo Island, a 1.5-hour ferry ride from Tongyeong Ferry Terminal, is famous for its striking seascape views. There's a coastal hiking path that leads to its tiny neighbor, Deungdaeseom Island (Lighthouse Island).\n\nBut there's a catch. The 150-meter-long trail appears for only for a few hours, twice a day, when the tides ebb. Other nearby islands worth visiting include Bijindo, Jangsado and Hansando.\n\nPro tip: Visit the ferry terminal the day before your trip to check the schedule as it changes daily because of weather conditions.\n\n7. Yi Sun-Sin Park\n\nAdmiral Yi Sun-sin's monument. Shin Kim/CNN\n\nAdmiral Yi Sun-sin (1545-1598), who led battles against the Japanese navy to victory on the Korean peninsula's southern coast, is a highly respected national hero.\n\nTributes to Admiral Yi are found everywhere in Tongyeong and surrounding areas, from shrines to shops named in his honor. There's even a replica of his turtle battle ship in Gangguan Port.\n\nYi Sun-sin Park is worth a visit for anyone who enjoys beautiful coastal views -- there's a nice walking path -- or has an interest in Korean history. Admiral Yi Sun-sin's monument is located a short but steep walk from the parking lot.\n\n8. The flavors of Tongyeong\n\nIn addition to that aforementioned raw fish market meal, there are plenty of restaurants serving local specialties such as sea squirt (meonggae) bibimbap, grilled fish and spicy hairtail stew -- all served with sides of seasonal, local produce and seafood.\n\nIf you're taking an early morning ferry to a nearby island pick up some chungmu kimbap -- mini rice rolls wrapped in seaweed with a side serving of spicy calamari salad and big chunks of radish kimchi.\n\nThis local specialty is found in about a dozen shops by the ferry terminal.\n\nRelated content 7 Korean dishes that are super spicy -- and tips for eating them\n\nLucky enough to be in Tongyeong with a group of people who can hold their drink?

Passengers excitedly raise their voices, snowboards and skis scraping across the floor as riders shuffle to move into better viewing positions to take in the incredible landscape below.\n\nIt's a common reaction among those first encountering the legendary \"snow monsters\" of Zao Onsen -- or \"juhyo\" in Japanese.\n\nThe excitement intensifies when passengers exit the tram and set out to explore the mysterious figures up close -- some on foot, others clutching their riding gear, ready to glide through the monsters as they make their way down the mountain.\n\nDo you want to build a snowman, Tim?\n\nThe juhyo phenomenon is the result of some pretty harsh weather systems.\n\nAs notoriously heavy winter storms rush though the Zao Mountain Range, blown in by a Siberian jet stream, trees on the upper sections of some peaks begin to collect thick, juicy layers of snow and ice.\n\nThe trees are eventually frozen into the fascinating forms that have turned this small village into a popular winter destination.\n\nMuch like staring into the clouds, part of the fun of exploring Zao's snow monsters includes playing the old \"what do you see\" game -- a snowy version of the Rorschach test.\n\nThe covered trees stand defiantly, bearing poses resembling everything from a cougar frozen mid-roar to a white witch pointing her long bony finger into the blue sky on the horizon.\n\nMany are grotesquely beautiful, deserving of a role in a Tim Burton film.\n\nWe see a wild cat roaring at a zombie as a large woman looks upon the scene disapprovingly. You? Karla Cripps/CNN\n\nRising popularity among foreigners\n\nThough the area is popular with Asia-based tourists, Western ski enthusiasts have traditionally been few in number.\n\nThat's slowly changing says Lyndell Keating, co-director of Powderhounds.com , an online powder skiing guide that also offers ski and snowboarding tours around the world, including in Japan.\n\nRelated content Tohoku: Beautiful scenes of an overlooked region\n\n\"Zao is definitely increasing in its popularity with foreigners,\" says Keating.\n\n\"Seven years ago, we didn't see any other gaijin [foreigners] and no one in the restaurants or our hotel spoke English. Whilst it's not as high-profile as many other Japanese ski resorts for foreigners -- e.g. Niseko, Hakuba, Nozawa Onsen, Myoko Kogen -- there are certainly more visiting now and English is more widely spoken.\"\n\nIndeed, Zao Onsen might not be the first choice for those in search of fresh powder and world-class ski runs.\n\nAt night, the Zao Snow Monsters are illuminated. Zao Ropeway\n\nBut it offers one of the easiest ways to experience the snow monsters, which are found in other parts of Japan though often require substantial efforts to access.\n\n\"If you haven't seen them before they can look pretty impressive and rather dramatic,\" says Keating.\n\n\"What sets Zao apart from other areas is that there are so many snow monsters in peak season, that non-skiers can readily view them, that they host evening illuminated sessions, and that there is a piste run through the middle of them.\"\n\nLay of the snow monster land\n\nTo reach the snow monsters, visitors take two connected, enclosed cable cars, the first of which starts from the main Zao Ski Resort ropeway base.\n\nFor skiers and snowboarders, access to the cable cars is included in the Zao Snow Resort lift package. For those on foot, there's a separate round-trip ticket.\n\nOnce at the top, visitors on foot can head out of the observation area to a roped-off section and roam freely among the snow monsters.\n\nThose planning to ski down the mountain head left to a separate trail that connects with Zao Ski Resort's other runs.\n\nThere are washrooms and a cafeteria-style restaurant in the observation center.\n\nAdvice for skiers/snowboarders\n\nSkiing through snow monsters at Zao Onsen. Courtesy JNTO\n\nZao Ski Resort , which is spread over several peaks, is a mid-sized facility that's ideal for beginner and intermediate riders. Its longest downhill course is a 10-kilometer stretch that starts up at the snow monster observation area.\n\nIt has 42 lifts -- three ropeways, one cable car and 37 chair lifts -- though the layout \"is not particularly ideal and some poling or skating may be required in places,\" says Powderhounds in its review of the resort.\n\nOverall, however, it's an excellent destination for anyone looking for a great day of riding in beautiful scenery.\n\nRelated content Where to find the world's best sake\n\nThe trail leading away from the snow monsters is not for newbies, which means visitors wanting to ski amongst them should evaluate their own abilities first.\n\n\"What's most scary about the snow monsters is that lots of ski tourists like to head down this trail, even if they are only beginners (it's an intermediate rated trail). You have to keep your wits about you,\" says Keating.\n\nAnd of course, bear in mind there's a reason the trees look like this -- the weather can get ugly. So if possible, plan your trip around the forecast.\n\nSome slopes are open for night skiing, excluding the trail leading from the snow monsters. Lessons are available, though those requiring an English instructor are advised to reserve ahead.\n\nRental gear can be found at the ski resort as well as various Zao Onsen shops and some of the bigger hotels.\n\nThis includes snowboards, skis, jackets and pants. Some shops offer helmet and goggle rentals as well, though helmets are not mandatory on the slopes. Gear quality and price varies.\n\nZao Onsen village\n\nZao Onsen itself is a small, walkable mountain village with huge charms, offering a classic small-town Japan experience.\n\nThis being an onsen (hot spring) town, the smell of sulfur is rich in the air -- a scent that can please or repel depending on individual tastes.\n\nIn addition to several public onsens, some hotels have their own in-house hot spring facilities.\n\nAccommodation options range from small inns to a few bigger resorts like Zao Shiki no Hotel , where guests can choose between traditional Japanese or Western-style rooms.\n\nZao Onsen has public hot spring bath houses, though many of the area's hotels offer in-house onsen facilities. Courtesy JNTO\n\nBreakfast and dinner is included as part of the room rate at some accommodations. If you're lucky you'll receive a serving of the phenomenal Yonezawa beef, which is raised in the same prefecture.\n\nIn the village, there are several quality restaurants serving the usual Japanese fare as well as classic izakaya-style bars.\n\nNeed a break from Japanese food? The adorable Craftbeer&Pizza Quantum serves up delicious pizza, has a great selection of beer and plays snowboarding videos.\n\nBut if it's nightlife you're after, you'll be partying on your own. This is not a party town and the streets are fairly dead when the sun goes down.\n\nRegardless, it's worth taking a nighttime stroll.\n\nAfter dark Zao Onsen adopts its own spooky vibe, with steam from the onsen waters rising in big white poofs out of the drains and streams that trickle through the town's hilly slopes. In some areas, colorful lights illuminate the steam.\n\nGetting there and when to go\n\nZao Onsen is worthy of a three-night stay, which will allow you ample time to fit in a bit of riding, hot spring soaking and snow monster exploring. If possible, go during the week -- we had the mountain to ourselves and lift lines were non-existent. Weekends are another story.\n\nThe best time to see the monsters is late January to early March, before the spring warmth seeps in.\n\nFrom January 27 to March 4 the cable cars run from 8:30 a.m. until 9 p.m for those wanting to see the snow monsters illuminated at night.\n\nThe easiest way to get to Zao Onsen is by train and bus. Bullet trains run direct from Tokyo to Yamagata Station throughout the day. The ride takes just over 2.5 hours. Some resorts offer pickups direct from Yamagata Station, which is about 16 kilometers away.\n\nOtherwise, buses depart every hour for Zao Onsen and the journey takes about 40 minutes.

Then the local government built a laboratory and began the study of cultivating oysters, collecting natural oyster larvae in water and then learning how to farm them under controlled conditions.\n\n\"By 1926 a complete system of oyster aquaculture was developed, and this resulted in the increased quality and production of oysters in the Matsushima Bay area.\"\n\n\n\nMatsushima FIsh Market's oyster shack, pictured on the left, is located in the parking lot.

After dark, however, once all the day trippers have departed, things get really quiet.\n\nThere are a few restaurants open in the evening but we recommend heading for Isozushi (4-12 Isozaki, Matsushima, +81 22-353-2826), a gorgeous little sushi joint tucked down a small road about one kilometer from the fish market.\n\nRun by a charming couple in their sixties, the restaurant's menu is no frills, meaning the seafood is the star.\n\nThe pair can't speak much English and there are no photos on the Japanese menu but if you just say \"omakase\" -- which basically means \"you can decide\" -- the chef will prepare a fantastic selection of local highlights for a decent price.\n\nWhat else is there to do?\n\nWhen you're not busy eating, you're going to want to spend some time exploring this walkable town and its famed bay.\n\nMany travelers visit Matsushima just for the day from nearby Sendai -- the capital of Miyagi prefecture -- but it's worth an overnight visit. There are a variety of inns and bigger, higher-end hotels. These include Matsushima Ichinobo , a large four-star property with lovely outdoor onsens (hot spring spas) overlooking the bay.\n\nTo truly appreciate Matsushima's beauty, head straight for the shore near the Matsushima Kaigan train station.\n\nSeveral islands are connected to the mainland by photo-worthy red bridges, such as the exquisite Fukuurabashi Bridge, which leads to Fukuurajima Island\n\nHome to more than 300 species of flowers, plants and trees, the island's network of walking paths leads to several viewpoints. Tickets can be purchased at Cafe Bayland, which is connected to the bridge's entrance.\n\nNearby, the beautiful Godaido Temple, founded in 807, sits on another small island that's also connected to the mainland via a series of red bridges.\n\nTo explore further afield, cruises depart from Matsushima Pier every hour. The 50-minute tour takes travelers around the bay, passing islands and oyster farms. A prerecorded narration offers info on the area in both English and Japanese.\n\nTickets can be purchased in the bay, near the Fukuurabashi Bridge.\n\nOther local attractions worth visiting include Saigyo Modoshi no Matsu Park (it offers great views of the bay) and a handful of picturesque temple complexes such as Entsuin and Zuiganji.\n\nGetting there\n\nMatsushima is located just under three hours by train from Tokyo Station. Travelers will need to transfer to the JR Senseki Line from Sendai Station and get off at Matsushima Kaigan Station, which is actually closer to the main sights than the main Matsushima Station.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/matsushima-bay-japan/index.html", "published": "2018-03-07T00:46:21+00:00"}, {"title": "Why Dubai is a 'playground for design'", "text": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

One third said they'd been required to move out with little to no notice when their employment had been terminated.\n\nRegardless of negative experiences, the report adds that a \"clear majority of participants reported that their expectations for their au pair experience were met or exceeded.\" More than 75% would recommend the experience, the report said.\n\nWorking for less than minimum wage\n\nGiven the opaque nature of the job and its connotations of cultural exchange, the report also found that the participants were often working for less than minimum wage.\n\nLina, an au pair from Malaysia, told the interviewers she felt she was exploited while working for a family in Melbourne, was underpaid and required to perform housekeeping duties.\n\nBerg said there is no clear guidance from the government on the rights of short-term workers, which creates confusion for au pairs and families about what is expected of them.\n\n\"For example, immigration rules consider au pairs to be workers but advice from the Fair Work Ombudsman and ATO (Australian Tax Office) is less clear about exactly when au pairs become employees,\" Berg said.\n\nWendi Aylward, managing director of AIFS Au Pair in Sydney and president of the Cultural Au Pair Association of Australia (CAPAA), a nationwide industry association, told CNN that when she founded her agency she had to look overseas for guidance on the standards to apply, as there was nothing specific to Australia.\n\nShe said the \"report reflects that there is an urgency now for the government to step in and put clarity around how this type of program works.\"\n\nAylward has been advocating for a special visa for au pairs which would provide better screening of prospective workers and families who are looking for help. The proposed system would allow for government oversight, she said, reducing the risk of exploitation.\n\n\"This crosses over a number of different areas of government -- immigration, child care, tourism. It will require work, but it's also time that it's done.

Temperature records across the state were shattered in recent days, in some places by several degrees, while more than 30 schools have been closed amid the ongoing extreme weather. In Cairns, on the Queensland coast, temperatures were so severe that hundreds of bats dropped dead in the heat, leaving wildlife workers to care for dozens of orphaned babies. Volunteers line up dead bats killed by a severe heat wave in Northern Queensland in November 2018. \"Today we witnessed just how devastating heat can be ... As we saved some more would drop from the tree. We have 100s of babies in care. Carers are stretched, broken and tired,\" North Queensland Wildlife Care said on its social media. Bureau of Meteorology's Sarah Fitton told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the two extreme weather events were connected. \"The trough that's moving through Queensland today and producing quite testing fire conditions is extending down into that low-pressure system that is through New South Wales, so there is a link between the systems,\" she told local media.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/australia/australia-sydney-rain-weather-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Renae Lawrence, 'Bali Nine' drug trafficker released from prison after 13 years", "text": "(CNN) The only female member of the infamous heroin-trafficking \"Bali Nine\" gang has been freed from prison, three years after the execution of the group's ringleaders caused huge tensions between Australia and Indonesia\n\nRenae Lawrence left Bali's Bangli jail through a media scrum after serving 13 years of her 20-year sentence.\n\nShe had been arrested alongside the eight other members of the group in 2005, after they were caught attempting to smuggle heroin out of Bali's international airport and into Australia. Lawrence had 2.7 kilograms (5.9 pounds) of the narcotic strapped to her body.\n\nA decade later, the execution by firing squad of the group's two ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, was met with outrage in Australia, in what then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott called a \"dark moment in the relationship\" between the two countries.\n\nLawrence, 41, left prison on Wednesday evening in Bali, and is expected to be deported to Australia shortly. She will be placed on a blacklist that bars her from ever returning to Indonesia, immigration officials said.\n\nRead More\n\nShe had initially been sentenced to life in prison, but later had the punishment commuted to 20 years and was released early on good behavior. Lawrence has said that Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the drug-trafficking scheme. She apologized to Indonesia during her court appeal. Another member of the group died from cancer in prison in June, and the remaining five are all serving life sentences, meaning Lawrence may be the only member of the group to ever leave jail. Police in New South Wales, where Lawrence is from, are likely to talk to have questions on her return, as there are two outstanding warrants for her arrest in the country relating to a high-speed chase involving a stolen vehicle, AFP reported. The case of the Bali Nine highlighted the strict laws on drug trafficking in Indonesia, where several foreigners are currently detained on similar charges. Last year, Australian woman Schapelle Corby was freed after nearly nine years in jail on the island, in a case which attracted similarly high levels of attention in Australia. 'Reformed characters' Lawrence's release is the latest development in a years-long saga which has seen several protracted legal battles, prompted a severe diplomatic spat and generated significant media coverage. It began when the members of the Bali Nine were arrested in 2005 by Indonesian police, following a tip-off from Australian authorities. Lawrence and four others were caught at Densapar International Airport with over 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies, while another four were found at a hotel on the island of Kuta. Chan, described as the ringleader, was captured after boarding a plane to Sydney. Death row appeal fails: Australian 'Bali Nine' drug smugglers face execution The smugglers fell foul of Indonesia's strict drug laws; Sukumaran and Chan were sentenced to death, and the other seven members were given life sentences in February 2006. Several of the group's members saw their time reduced to 20 years soon after, only to have life imprisonment sentences reinstated on appeal. Lawrence did not appeal her 20-year sentence. Australia repeatedly pleaded for clemency over Sukumaran and Chan's executions, only to have their appeals denied. The two men's legal teams had also fought for years to have their sentences reduced. \"Both men are reformed characters and both have helped to rehabilitate other prisoners. The prerogative of mercy should be extended to them,\" Abbott said in 2015 in an unsuccessful effort to spare them the death penalty. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo rejected the calls, saying \"our legal sovereignty must be respected.\" Australia recalled its ambassador to Indonesia after the men were executed. Widodo told CNN that year that the country was in the midst of a \"drugs crisis,\" and insisted that he would not be swayed by clemency appeals.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/21/australia/bali-nine-renae-lawrence-released-scli-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Australia refuses to sign UN migration pact", "text": "(CNN) Australia will not join a United Nations-backed global pact on migration, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Wednesday, citing concerns that the deal would be used to \"undermine Australia's strong border protection laws and practices.\"\n\nThe Morrison government's decision comes as countries from around the world move to formally adopt the \" Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration \" pact next month.\n\nThe UN made the decision to come up with a global compact on migration in 2016, in the wake of the crisis in the Mediterranean , which has seen thousands of migrants die while attempting to cross into Europe.\n\nA draft of the agreement, which is not legally binding, was finalized in July after more than a year of work\n\nMorrison said in a statement that his government believes the pact, as currently written, is not in Australia's interest and will not \"add anything to enhancing our capacity to control our borders and manage our successful immigration program.\"\n\n\"The Compact fails to adequately distinguish between people who enter Australia illegally and those who come to Australia the right way, particularly with respect to the provision of welfare and other benefits,\" the statement read.\n\n\"This is inconsistent with the management of Australia's strong and orderly migration program under the Liberal National Government.\"\n\nAustralia has come under fire from international rights groups for its strict immigration laws.\n\nFor years , asylum-seekers who were caught illegally entering Australia by boat were sent to processing centers on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus island.

From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own.\n\n(CNN) With the presidents of the United States and Russia staying home, it seemed Chinese President Xi Jinping would dominate this weekend at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and increase his country's influence in the Pacific.\n\nChina has already lent at least $1.3 billion to the Pacific Islands and about $590 million alone to the summit's host, Papua New Guinea (PNG). And to coincide with the PNG visit, Beijing promised $4 billion of finance to build PNG's first national road network, one of several gestures for which China secured effusive praise from Pacific Island countries including Samoa, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Niue, Fiji and the President of the Federated States of Micronesia.\n\nBut nevertheless, Xi left PNG dissatisfied and disgruntled.\n\nFor the first time in APEC's 25-year history, PNG was forced to end the summit with leaders failing to agree on a communique . And Beijing was also left embarrassed by reports of four Chinese officials being unceremoniously banished from the office of PNG Foreign Minister Rimbink Pato after allegedly trying to influence his statement.\n\nThe Director General of China's Department of International Economic Affairs, Wang Xiaolong, was reported as saying this was \"simply not true.\"\n\nFor China, the trade summit should have been a public relations victory -- but it was turned into partial defeat when Chinese officials barred most reporters from participant countries and other international outlets from the forum and instead only allowed Chinese state-owned media journalists, citing space and security concerns according to Reuters.\n\nConcerted and coordinated push back by the US and its allies\n\nOf more enduring consequence than diplomatic embarrassment, is the concerted and coordinated push back by the US and its allies -- such as Japan and Australia -- which was done in a very public way. Earlier this month, Australia announced a $2.2 billion \"step-up to the Pacific\" -- which includes an Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility and an export credit agency to help Australian companies invest in the region.\n\nThen on Saturday, the Trilateral Partnership countries of the US, Japan and Australia released a joint statement declaring together they would identify infrastructure projects for development and financing. Pointedly, these projects would adhere to \"international standards and principles for development, including openness, transparency, and fiscal sustainability.\" That approach, it said, would \"help to meet the region's genuine needs while avoiding unsustainable debt burdens for the nations of the region.\"\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence was even more blunt during his speech at the APEC summit.\n\nTaking a swipe at China, he said that the US \"offers a better option\" and \"does not drown partners in a sea of debt...coerce\" them or \"compromise\" their independence.\n\nTo indicate that the US and allied powers were serious about using economic and military means to counter Chinese influence, Pence announced over the weekend the US will join with Australia and PNG to redevelop and create a joint naval base on Manus Island. \"We will work with these two nations to protect sovereignty and maritime rights in the Pacific Islands,\" he said.\n\nPublic distaste for 'sharp power' on show\n\nthat China Previously, in August, it was reportedthat China could be given the contract to redevelop a port on Manus Island. A military facility on Manus Island is of high strategic significance -- this is a deep-water port capable of hosting aircraft carriers and hundreds of naval vessels.\n\nAs one of the most important bases for the US fleet in the Pacific theater during World War II, it will be a second line of defence should China's People's Liberation Army Navy successfully break out of the so-called First Island Chain, a line of archipelagos that cover the Kuril Islands, Japan, Taiwan, northern Philippines and Borneo, and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBut even if the reports about Chinese involvement in the Manus Island port are untrue, Beijing would be alarmed at the prospect of American and Australian military assets in PNG to counter any Chinese naval breakout.\n\nAs far as Beijing is concerned, the weekend was the time to showcase China's emergence as a benign superpower in the South Pacific. Instead, public distaste for and rebuke of its 'sharp power' was on show.\n\nXi defended China's trade practices and denied that its Belt and Road Initiative contained hidden geo-political and other sinister motivations. And no matter how adamantly he did so, it was not a conversation that Xi intended to have when he first landed in Port Moresby.\n\nAnd it has not ended.\n\nThe more China offers economic largesse and inducements, the more it will need to reassure the recipient and the world that it is not laying a 'debt trap' or seeking to buy influence.\n\nThe weekend was supposed to be China's moment in the sun during this most important regional economic meeting. Instead, it became obvious to all that Beijing's ambitions are as feared and resisted by at least as many countries, as welcomed by others.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/18/asia/china-apec-analysis-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-18T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Melbourne 'trolley man' hailed as hero after attack appears in court", "text": "(CNN) A homeless man who was hailed as a hero after intervening in a terror attack in the Australian city of Melbourne just over a week ago has appeared in court charged with theft, Australia's ABC News reported.\n\nMichael Rogers was captured in shaky cellphone images from the scene repeatedly shoving a shopping cart, known as a shopping trolley in Australia, at attacker Hassan Khalif Shire Ali who had just stabbed three people and was threatening police officers with a knife.\n\nAfter Rogers, nicknamed \"trolley man,\" was identified as the brave bystander concerned, a GoFundMe page was set up in his honor.\n\nPolice subsequently said they wanted to question Rogers, 46, over alleged offenses that predated the Melbourne attack, ABC reported.

But for months, experts have been warning the city isn't ready, and concerns remain over costs, infrastructure and security.\n\nThis is the first time Papua New Guinea (PNG), the poorest of the 21 countries in APEC, has hosted the summit. PNG ranks 110th worldwide for GDP, with an economy roughly the size of Cyprus or Afghanistan, according to the World Bank, and far behind richer APEC nations like Australia or China.\n\nSome leaders won't even be staying in the PNG capital -- often ranked one of the most dangerous cities in the world -- and instead are flying in and out of the country via the Australian city of Cairns, across the Coral Sea.\n\nOther leaders are staying away altogether. US President Donald Trump decided not to attend the summit, sending Vice President Mike Pence in his place, though Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Xi Jinping will both be in PNG.\n\nViolence and disorder\n\nIn June, PNG's government declared a nine-month state of emergency and sent in the military following intensive violence in the Southern Highlands province (SHP), where rioters looted businesses and torched a government plane and court buildings. One commentator described the situation in parts of the country as close to \"civil war.\"\n\n\"The full scale of crime and violence in Papua New Guinea is difficult to assess, given the limited coverage and poor quality of police and other data,\" academic and PNG expert Sinclair Dinnen wrote in a report for Australia's Lowy Institute in December . \"Levels of unreported crime, including rape and other sexual offenses, are extremely high, particularly in rural areas where access to police is limited.

However, it warned that the growing presence of foreign private security firms \"undermines the state's ability and authority\" to deliver these services.\n\nRegional militaries have largely stepped in to fill the gap, with both New Zealand and Australian providing training and resources to their PNG counterparts.\n\nThis photo taken on November 5, 2018, shows Papua New Guinea security forces on parade in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nPutting PNG on the map\n\nFor the PNG government, APEC seems like a silver bullet to many of its problems, raising the country's profile and helping it break free of a reputation for chaos and danger that has dogged it for decades.\n\nBut some critics have warned that the meeting of regional leaders could do the very opposite, exposing systemic issues within PNG and embarrassing it in front of the world.\n\nAs far back as 2016, opposition lawmakers were urging the government to \"swallow its pride\" and cancel the summit, saying it would be a waste of resources.\n\nFormer PNG Prime Minister Mekere Morauta in July accused the current government of converting the two-day summit into a \"cargo cult.\"\n\n\"APEC will not solve PNG's problems such as the rampant corruption, high unemployment, escalating crime, deteriorating state of health centers and hospitals as well as classrooms, roads, telecommunication and transport services,\" he said.\n\nMany were particularly enraged by the government's purchase of 40 custom-made Maserati cars -- which were flown in from Italy -- for leaders to use while they're in Port Moresby.\n\nNeighboring Australia is bearing a large part of the bill for the summit -- upwards of $90 million (130 million AUD), according to the ABC -- as is China, which has been significantly increasing its footprint in the Pacific , to no small concern in Canberra and other regional capitals.\n\nPapua New Guinea Prime Minister Peter O'Neill gives a talk at the Lowy Institute in Sydney on May 14, 2015.\n\nCritics of Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, who has been dogged by accusations of corruption for years, have accused him of seeking to distract from other issues with the splashy international conference, a repeat, some said, of the 2015 Pacific Games.\n\n\"Three years later, some of the South Pacific Games venues are still to be completed, others are not open to the general public, and many have been closed temporarily due to unpaid service bills accumulated from the Games,\" according to Watna Mori , director of PNG Presence, a consultancy firm. \"This is an example of what may happen to the infrastructure being built now to host the APEC summit.\"\n\nLast month, opposition lawmakers called for a nationwide stay at home strike over high government spending and alleged corruption in the run-up to APEC.\n\nAt a forum in Brisbane in May, O'Neill defended his government's focus on APEC, saying the summit would put PNG on the map, ensuring \"everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is\" and not confuse it with an African country.\n\nThis photo taken on November 4, 2018, shows the Australian warship HMAS Adelaide moored off APEC Haus in Port Moresby, the host city for the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit from November 17.\n\nHeavy security presence\n\nO'Neill's government has pulled out all the stops to ensure the summit goes off without a hitch, and residents of the capital can expect a massive security presence while world leaders are visiting PNG.\n\nPolice have vowed to crack down hard on any unlawful public assembly or protest around the summit, with Deputy Police Commissioner Jim Andrews saying in a statement last month that \"all public servants including members of the Constabulary are duty bound and obligated towards ensuring that government efforts geared towards the 2018 APEC Summit is cohesively supported and maintained.\"\n\nAndrews warned police \"would not hesitate to arrest and detain opportunists and trouble makers who defy lawful authority by disturbing peace and good order in the community.\"\n\nAlongside local police and military, many of the troops providing security for the summit will be foreign.

From 2016 until April 2018 he was senior national security adviser to the Australian foreign minister and also served as the lead adviser on the 2017 Foreign Policy White Paper. The opinions expressed here are his own.\n\n(CNN) On the day Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne met Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing to signal the beginning of a thaw in the Australia-China bilateral relationship, her boss, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, announced a $2.2 billion infrastructure package as part of the government's \"step-up to the Pacific.\"\n\nFew Australian politicians want to admit that the \"step-up\" is targeted against another country. But it is occurring as Australians are becoming increasingly concerned with the significant Chinese increase of its diplomatic, economic and potentially military presence in the South Pacific, an area that has long been considered by Canberra to be its \"backyard.\"\n\nThe motivation for this massive investment is the worst kept secret in Australian foreign policy: Australians know it is about China; the South Pacific Islands know it is about China; even Beijing knows it is about China.\n\nIs Australia over-reacting? If not, why now? And can an economy less than one-eighth the size of China's really compete with the latter's ambitions in the South Pacific?\n\nFor foreigners, the national importance Australia attaches to the Pacific might be difficult to understand. In April 2018, Australian media reports claimed China had approached Vanuatu about building up its military presence on the island, and potentially opening a military base. Having given the island of around 270,000 people hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid, the reports also indicated that Beijing had been negotiating with Vanuatu about host and even basing rights for People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy ships.\n\nNo subsequent proof of these supposed negotiations was released. It was later denied by Vanuatu and rubbished by China. Even so, the reports generated at least as much popular interest and concern as China's well-known island-building program in the South China Sea and militarization of these artificial islands.\n\nIn Australian strategic circles, the notion of a supposed naval base around 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) from its shoreline did more than raise eyebrows. It played into the country's sense of vulnerability.\n\nAs reaffirmed in the 2016 Defense White Paper , the highest priority has been given to ensuring that no potentially hostile power is able to approach the Australian continent from Southeast Asia or the South Pacific in its national defense strategy.\n\nMoreover, it has long been unofficial policy between allies that the United States and Japan secure Northeast Asia, the US with Australian support secures Southeast Asia, and Australia takes the primary responsibility for securing the South Pacific. Perhaps a naval base hosting PLA vessels in Vanuatu was never in the cards.\n\nBut the PLA is seeking to enhance its reach and any permanent Chinese military presence in the South Pacific would allow the its Navy to \"break out\" into the Western Pacific Ocean. That scenario -- or any other base offered to it by a poor and desperate Pacific Island -- would fundamentally undermine Australian strategic policy which has been in place since the end of World War II.\n\nThis brings us back to Morrison's multi-billion infrastructure package, which includes funding an infrastructure bank for projects in the region. In the previous decade, Chinese funding of Pacific Island countries was part of its strategy of using \"checkbook diplomacy\" to persuade small island countries to recognize the People's Republic of China rather than Taiwan as the true \"China.\"\n\nAt least according to the Australian view, Chinese checkbook diplomacy is now about more than seeking official recognition at Taiwan's expense. It is also about winning over these small countries to China's way of thinking, whether it be about basing rights, controlling critical infrastructure in those countries or forcing states to turn a blind eye to controversial Chinese policies such as in the South China Sea\n\nBeijing achieves this through showering small economies -- which would otherwise find it difficult to attract foreign investment -- with cheap loans. As has occurred in Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan, the tendency of these small and developing economies to accept far more debt that they can repay allows Beijing to dictate the political and/or strategic terms of any debt-forgiveness or restructuring assistance.\n\nPersistent suspicion that China is seeking to use Hanabata and Gwadar Ports in debt-ridden Sri Lanka and Pakistan respectively for military purposes in the future only raises the discomfort levels for Australia when it comes to China in the South Pacific.\n\nCertainly, China does not take half-measures. Since 2011, it has offered at least $1.3 billion in donations and concessionary loans to Pacific Island countries. This surpasses the $1.2 billion New Zealand has given over the same period. China's amount is second only to the $6.6 billion from Australia.\n\nTo be sure, Australia remains the preeminent aid and development contributor to the South Pacific and its decades of working with these small island economies means Canberra is well-positioned to remain the \"partner of choice.\"\n\nEven so, Australia has been largely reactive and playing defense to China offense. For example, Canberra signed an agreement with the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea in July to pay for undersea cables between the three countries in a last-minute bid to prevent Chinese firm Huawei from receiving the contract. In September, Canberra joined with the US in a last ditch attempt to thwart Huawei winning approval to build the domestic Internet cable network in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThese, and other, efforts have been reactive to Chinese overtures.\n\nThe point is not to outbid China in terms of short-term generosity or allow Pacific Island nations to play Australia off against China to maximize both countries' largesse. Morrison intends to ensure that these small economies will choose an Australian backed funding source which abides by World Bank and other international commercial standards but where access is fast-tracked and not held up by unnecessary regulations (typical of World Bank and Asian Development Bank Loans), and which impose repayment terms that are sustainable and will not endanger the solvency of these economies.\n\nAustralia knows it cannot keep China out of the South Pacific. But it can warn these developing economies about the price of severe indebtedness to China and offer them a ready alternative when it comes to the funding of critical infrastructure which would have domestic and/or regional security implications.\n\nMost of all, recent Australian policy is belated recognition it needs to compete in a region which has remain benign and free from potentially hostile external influence for over seven decades.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/08/australia/australia-china-south-pacific-analysis-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-08T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Family found dead, child missing, near vehicle in Australian outback", "text": "(CNN) A young family of three has been found dead next to a broken-down vehicle in a remote part of Australia's Northern Territory, according to police, who said a 12-year-old boy was still missing.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Northern Territory Police said a 19-year-old man and woman had been found, along with a three-year-old boy, next to the vehicle 350 kilometers (217 miles) northwest of Alice Springs in the Willowra district.\n\n\"(Police) identified that it wasn't a fatal motor vehicle accident as reported ...

Vijay Kumar, co-founder of the India Pride Project (IPP), a global network of volunteers which tracks down and repatriates Indian heritage works.\n\n\"The Indian and Australian authorities are already in discussion. From our side, we have submitted the paperwork and Australia has 30 days to refute (the claim).\"\n\nKumar, an amateur temple art investigator and author of book \"The Idol Thief,\" said that the AGSA had positively identified the object from archive photography in 2016.\n\n\"It's shocking that they waited almost two years knowing very well they had a suspect object. The argument they put forward is that the photo in the archive was taken in 1958 but still that doesn't say much about their own ethics,\" he told CNN.\n\n\"A stolen object continues to be a stolen object and India has its own antiquity laws.\"\n\nThe repatriation process will involve the federal governments of both countries.\n\nThe ABC reported that the gallery had purchased the 76 cm (30 in) tall, 100 kg (220 lb) artifact in 2001 with AUD 436,000 (around $330,000) in donated funds. The gallery had identified 24 potentially problematic pieces in its collection; the Shiva statue is the first one to have been claimed by India.\n\nDocuments seen by the Australian broadcaster say that the piece was bought, through British brokers, from a private European collector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 22 The \"Apollo and Venus\" painting by 16th-century Dutch master Otto van Veen (1556-1629) was discovered in the closet of an art gallery in Iowa, and is likely worth over $4 million.\n\n\n\nScroll through the gallery for other examples of lost and found artworks.

CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation , a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nIn the post-war decades, Australian communities invested heavily in churches. Like civic centers, swimming pools and shire halls, these buildings made an important contribution to the formation of a modern civic realm in Australia's growing cities, suburbs and regional communities.\n\nToday, dwindling numbers of constituents and the amalgamation of congregations have placed many post-war church buildings at risk. And yet -- unlike their publicly funded counterparts -- these structures are largely ignored in discussions around architecture and conservation. Few churches enjoy any form of heritage protection. Could this be because they represent an \"uneasy heritage\"?\n\nGiven current crises affecting churches in Australia, and given the important role these buildings played in the post-war development of the country's cities, suburbs and towns, a public debate is necessary about their future. Should we allow these buildings to disappear from memory, or should they be preserved or repurposed?\n\nSt Monica's War Memorial Cathedral, Cairns, on the Queensland Heritage Register. Credit: Ian Ferrier Slide Collection\n\nAcross Australia, only about 30 post-war ecclesiastical buildings have been included on state heritage registers. It's a meager number, given that several thousand churches were built across the country during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn Queensland alone, over 1,000 were built between 1945 and 1975. Of these, only six are on the Queensland Heritage Register.\n\nMirroring modern Australia's emergence\n\nIn the immediate post-war years, modern church-building in Australia made a hesitant start. A few small, rather conventional structures began cropping up.\n\nIn the 1950s, however, hesitation gave way to optimism, resulting in increased experimentation. By the 1960s, a genuine modern church boom was under way.\n\nSt Andrews Presbyterian Church, Gosford, New South Wales, demolished in 2002 Credit: Cross-Section, no. 95\n\nReligious institutions strongly supported the Australian government's bid to build a modern welfare state. As such, they not only built community-oriented churches, but also kindergartens, halls, primary and secondary schools, charity outreach centers and hospitals.\n\nFrom the 1960s, churches and their architects increasingly recognized the need to rethink ecclesiastical architecture, in order to cater to (rather than ignore or shun) modern society. This \"aggiornamento,\" or bringing up to date, in the religious sphere coincided with architects' experiments with modern materials, new construction technologies and innovative shapes and forms.\n\nSt Christopher's Catholic Church. Anglesea, Victoria. Credit: Cross-section no. 188, June 1968\n\nAs a result, a new \"type\" of church emerged. It was one more attuned to its (commonly) residential surroundings, and more sensitive to its context, both in terms of materiality and scale.\n\nExamples abound from the 1960s, but of note are Kenmore Presbyterian Church (now Uniting Church) in Queensland; St Anne's Church of England by in Como, New South Wales, which was repurposed as a private residence in 1997, along with its Sunday school building; and St Christopher's Catholic Church, which was damaged in 1983 bushfires and rebuilt to a revised design the following year.\n\nKenmore Presbyterian Church Brisbane, Queensland. Credit: Lisa Marie Daunt (2000)\n\nThese smaller, contextually sensitive structures -- designs that reflect the \"aggiornamento\" of the church -- represent the bulk of post-war modern church buildings in Australia. However, state heritage registers are mostly populated by their more \"monumental\" siblings.\n\nAnd yet it is the smaller, unassuming churches that made the greatest contribution to the formation of our post-war collective realm. More importantly, it is these churches that are under the greatest threat.\n\nHoly Trinity National Memorial Finnish Lutheran Church Turner, Canberra Credit: Lisa Marie Daunt (2016)\n\nSo, what is to be done? Is this part of our modern heritage best forgotten, along with the (at times) painful memories it evokes?

In the past 26 years, Godolphin horses have won 5,190 races, including 288 Group 1 wins.\n\nThat's a strike rate of 20% for the group -- the racing arm of Sheikh Mohammed's Darley breeding operation -- which has outposts in Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Ireland, France, the US and Australia.\n\nStill, until this week, Godolphin had only three second places and two third places to show for in the Melbourne Cup, despite investing as much as A$1.1 billion ($800 million) in the sport Down Under, according to a 2016 report by the Australian Financial Review citing Godolphin Australia's financial results filed with the country's corporate regulator the year before.\n\n\"Learning curve\"\n\nIn 2016, Godolphin sent five horses to Australia to compete in the race, only to walk away empty-handed once again.\n\nThis year, Sheikh Mohammed had three runners in the Melbourne Cup, spread across his three training operations headed by Appleby and Saeed Bin Suroor in the UK and UAE and James Cummings in Australia.\n\nBin Suroor's Best Solution and Cummings' Avilius finished eighth and 22nd respectively, but Appleby struck gold.\n\n\"We've been competitive, but we've learnt more on each trip about what will make us more competitive,\" said Appleby, who was saddling his third Melbourne Cup entry after stepping up from assistant trainer in 2013 following the eight-year ban handed to then Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni for illegally administering steroids to some of his horses.\n\n\"That's what it's all about, the learning curve. I'm just in a fortunate position to have the horses to make the call on which are the right ones to bring down here.\"\n\nCross Counter (R) wins the Melbourne Cup ahead of fellow British horse Marmelo.\n\nThe Newmarket-based Appleby, who gave Godolphin its first Epsom Derby winner, Masar, in June, added: \"This is huge for everybody. For me, of course this is the biggest thing along with the Derby. This year has just been one of those amazing years.\"\n\nStellar 2018\n\nAfter some fallow years, this season has proved to be stellar one for Godolphin, which ended the British Flat racing season as the leading owner, claiming 113 wins, including its first Epsom Derby, and winning \u00a34.5 million in prize money, according to the website of the British Horseracing Authority.\n\nBin Suroor's Thunder Snow also won the $10 million Dubai World Cup in Meydan in March.\n\nBut horse racing is a costly business and often prize money doesn't cover the costs unless the horse is used for breeding.\n\nIn a perfect completion to a stellar year highlighted by #Masar's Derby victory, #ThunderSnow's Dubai World Cup and 27 other G1s, #CrossCounter epitomised the #Godolphin philosophy of pushing global boundaries and striving for perfection https://t.co/i7NWKOj8zs \u2014 Godolphin (@godolphin) November 6, 2018\n\nDuring the 2018 Flat season, Goldophin fielded 242 horses in Britain.

What could it hurt to eat a small slug?\n\nSo Australian teenager Sam Ballard grabbed the slimy creature and gulped it down. He had no idea that the slug carried a potentially deadly worm that would put him into a coma that lasted more than a year, paralyze his body and ultimately take his life.\n\n'Trying to act like grown-ups'\n\nIn 2010, 19-year-old Sam, an avid rugby player, was drinking with Jimmy Galvin and several more of his Australian \"mates\" when a slug began crawling across Galvin's concrete patio at his home in Sydney.\n\n\"We were sitting over here, having a bit of red wine appreciation night, trying to act as grown-ups,\" Galvin recalled in a video interview this year with Lisa Wilkinson of \"The Sunday Project,\" a current affairs talk show that airs on Network 10 in Australia.CNN reached out to Galvin but has not heard back.\n\n\"And then the conversation came up, 'Should I eat it?' \" recalled Galvin. \"And then off Sam went and bang, that's how it happened.\"\n\nIn this special report @Lisa_Wilkinson talks to the amazing family and friends of Sam Ballard #TheProjectTV pic.twitter.com/UXY5KGeWjF \u2014 The Project (@theprojecttv) April 1, 2018\n\nAfter downing the slug, Sam became weak and complained of severe pain in his legs, according to \"The Sunday Project.\" Sam's mother, Katie Ballard, told the news show that at first they worried he might have multiple sclerosis, which had afflicted her husband. But doctors said no, that wasn't the cause.\n\nThen Sam turned to his mother and told her he had eaten a slug, \"And I went, 'No, no one gets sick from that,' \" Katie Ballard said. CNN has also reached out to Ballard.\n\nSoon, however, doctors told them otherwise. Sam had developed rat lungworm disease from the infected slug, changing his life forever.\n\nKatie Ballard, left, with her son, Sam Ballard, in Sydney.\n\nWhat is rat lungworm disease?\n\nRat lungworm disease is caused by a parasitic worm called Angiostronjilus cantonensis. As the name suggests, the parasite lodges in the lungs of rats and is later excreted in poop.\n\nAlong comes a slug, snail, freshwater crab, shrimp, prawn or frog, and either eats the rat dung or the parasite works its way into the creature infecting it. Fish, however, do not spread the parasite.\n\nHumans can be infected if they eat the raw or undercooked contaminated animals, or vegetables carrying unseen snails or slugs that have not been thoroughly washed.\n\nIn addition, says the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , beverages can become contaminated with worms if left open for snails and slugs to enter.\n\nUnlike in rats, the worm's life cycle is not completed in a human. So instead of passing through the digestive tract, the worm larvae \"can get lost, and it will go to the brain, and it'll stay there,\" said Heather Stockdale Walden, an assistant professor in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Pathology at the University of Florida. The parasite is not passed from human to human.\n\n\"When it gets to the brain, you can have eosinophilic meningitis,\" Walden said , which is an inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\n\nSymptoms can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, fever and a stiff neck, the CDC said.\n\n'So full of love'\n\nMost cases of rat lungworm disease are typically mild. But in some cases, like Sam's, the disease can cause catastrophic damage.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis, Sam fell into a coma, where he remained for 420 days, Ballard said in the Australian news report. He woke up paralyzed, unable to eat without a tube or move without intense effort. He required 24-hour care, seven days a week.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut the disease didn't affect his mental faculties, his family and friends said.\n\n\"He's in there, 100%,\" Galvin told \"The Sunday Project.\" \"I apologized to Sam about everything that happened that night in the backyard. And he just started bawling his eyes out. I know he's there.\"\n\nLate last week, Sam died, \"The Sunday Project's\" Wilkinson wrote in a blog post\n\n\"Sam passed away on Friday morning at Hornsby Hospital, not far from where he grew up, surrounded by 20 of those he most loved in the world,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Katie tells me 'the room was so full of love,' \" Wilkinson said. \"One of his friends there in the room continued, 'He had his voice and he said \"I love you\" several times to Katie.' \"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/05/health/man-dies-after-eating-slug-on-dare/index.html", "published": "2018-11-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Rubella is eliminated in Australia as the disease prompts a travel warning for Japan", "text": "(CNN) Australia has eliminated rubella, a disease also known as German measles that's already been eliminated in the Americas and across much of Europe, the World Health Organization said Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement, which Australia's health minister called a \"highly significant public health accomplishment,\" comes just days after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned travelers -- especially pregnant women -- about an outbreak of the disease in Japan.\n\nRubella is highly contagious but considered mild for adults , who may develop a rash and a fever for about two to three days, though some people do not feel sick at all.\n\nHowever, it is also the leading vaccine-preventable cause of birth defects, studies show , and can cause miscarriage, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy.\n\nWomen who are pregnant and who are not protected by a vaccine or a previous rubella infection should not to travel to Japan during the current outbreak, which is centered mostly in the Kanto region, which includes Tokyo, the CDC warns.\n\nThe disease's elimination in Australia proves the country's immunization program is a success, the health minister said.\n\n\"The elimination of rubella is a great day for public health in Australia and sends a powerful message that vaccinations work,\" Hunt said. \"I commend the efforts of Australia's health professionals over the decades and the millions of parents who ensure their children are always vaccinated.\"\n\nAustralia's nationwide immunization rate for 5-year-olds has hit a record at more than 94%, Hunt said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAustralia had rolling epidemics of rubella over the years, with the most cases -- about 5,000 -- identified in 1958.

It also does cartoons.\n\nAustralia is the nicest racist country you will ever see. It is racist in a blithe, jokey kind of way, where nobody is supposed to take anything too seriously, and nobody is too aware of historical or cultural contexts.\n\nThere is racial violence in Australia's history, but not a lot of it, compared with many other countries, and it's not very recent. The racism you get in Australia is mostly of the blindness to privilege variety, where a person may make fun of another for their distinguishing characteristics without realizing that doing so is far more comfortable from within the demographic majority.\n\nThe Herald-Sun is full of such casual racism, along with a lot of other idiocies. I read it almost every day, starting with the always entertaining letters to the editor, where the ignorant and misinformed produce tyrannical and byzantine solutions to the world's problems, as well as complaining about gas prices. Also it does have excellent football coverage.\n\nRead More\n\nIts Serena Williams cartoon, published Monday, was shocking in its harkening back to century-old Jim Crow-style imagery, but not exactly surprising, because there is something like that in the Herald-Sun all the time. It was also unsurprising in how the newspaper and its cartoonist, Mark Knight, subsequently defended the cartoon , which was simply to deny it has anything to do with race. (The Herald-Sun used a favorite phrase: \"The world has gone mad.\") Because, in Australia, if no offense is intended, none can be taken.

There's little doubt that Knight grossly exaggerated the nose and lips of Williams for the same reason he exaggerates the physical characteristics of most of his cartoons' subjects: They are caricatures, and, as such, he targets differences and explodes them. But he must have been aware of, and deliberately ignored, the historical echoes of his cartoon -- the exaggerated lips and nose reminiscent of racist depictions of black people in the United Statesduring Jim Crow. On base logic, he was right to do so: It created only a minor stir domestically, and, I'm sure, more laughs than gasps among its core readership. To be clear, the Herald-Sun isn't a niche publication: It is the biggest-selling newspaper in Melbourne, Australia's most liberal city. It finds an audience because, in typical Murdoch media fashion, it delivers cheap, bright, digestible dollops of news and entertainment, mostly the latter, to people without a lot of free time. Even during election season, when the hand of Murdoch can be seen banging ever more stridently on the political drums, you will always find at least one snap of plucky kids or an interesting dog. Australians often find it unclear why such things as Knight's cartoon are considered racist. Less than a decade ago, we couldn't understand why singer Harry Connick, Jr. was offended by a blackface performance during a TV show. A few years ago, my own daughter was given a golliwog doll. These things are intended as gentle humor, in good spirit, and expected to be taken that way. This will change\u2014slowly, much more slowly than in countries like the United States, with its vastly greater direct exposure to African peoples, culture and history.

The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\n(CNN) There is a certain mindset in politics, present the world over and across the political spectrum, which distrusts expertise. That mindset is presently revealing itself in Australia, where this week a small group of conservative-minded members of parliament held the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, hostage over climate policy .\n\nTurnbull's center-right Liberal party had pledged to reduce emissions from Australia's energy companies more than a quarter (from 2005 levels) by 2030, a key part of its efforts to meet its international obligations.\n\nBut several of his own MPs, led by his predecessor as prime minister and long-term rival Tony Abbott, forced him into a climbdown by threatening to vote against the legislation. Turnbull's government barely has a majority in the House of Representatives, and losing such a key vote could have led to a leadership challenge. Cowed, he dropped the pledge, and on Tuesday narrowly survived the revolt.\n\nInternal Liberal party politics are one thing. But the symbolism of the gesture is telling. Australia is a country where environmental damage is obvious, in the form of the hole in the ozone layer over the Antarctic caused by use of CFCs decades ago, the steady bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef from warming, carbon-dioxide-acidified seas, and the ever more prevalent bushfires.\n\nYet for large parts of the political class here, and the people who vote for them, climate change is seen as a scam perpetrated by liberal, anti-business scientists.\n\nOne in five Australians, a poll last year showed, believe that climate change is a \"hoax.\" Another poll in 2015 declared that Australia was the most climate-skeptical nation on Earth.\n\nAbbott himself has said that the \"settled science\" of climate change is \" absolute crap \" and that efforts to reduce its impact are like \"killing goats to appease the volcano gods.\" Another politician, the anti-immigration populist Malcolm Roberts, has clashed with scientist Brian Cox, claiming that NASA data was \"manipulated\" to make climate change appear worse than it was, to Cox's astonishment.\n\nFor the record, climate change is not a hoax. There is some debate over how extreme the warming will be, but the warming so far has been within predicted levels. NASA has not been falsifying data. This is conspiratorial, anti-scientific nonsense.\n\nBut anti-scientific nonsense is extremely appealing at the populist fringes of politics. In the US, President Donald Trump has also called climate change a hoax, perpetrated by the Chinese , and has been filling the Environmental Protection Agency with climate skeptics, including former chief Scott Pruitt, now resigned amid multiple ethics scandals\n\nTrump is also anti-vaccine, associating with Andrew Wakefield, the disgraced, fraudulent British doctor behind the discredited research linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine to autism, and weirdly claiming that multi-vaccine injections are bad because \" tiny children are not horses .\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump tweets climate change could be 'good' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump tweets climate change could be 'good' 02:07\n\nBritish politics has its own share of climate skeptics and anti-vaccination conspiracy theorists, especially on the UKIP-led hard right. And the left is not innocent -- the left-wing populist leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn, once signed a parliamentary motion supporting the pseudoscientific alternative medicine homeopathy, tweeting that it \"works for some people .\" The Green Party is resolutely anti-nuclear and anti-genetically modified organisms.\n\nWhat all these positions have in common is a distrust of what \"the experts\" are saying -- the relevant scientists who are almost uniformly convinced that climate change is real, human-made and dangerous; that vaccines are safe and highly effective; that homeopathy is ineffective, and that nuclear power and GMOs are important tools for powering and feeding the world.\n\nPopulism offers simple, intuitive alternatives to complex, messy reality. For example, immigrants or the EU are behind all your problems ; get rid of them and it'll all be OK. That makes populism almost directly opposed to science.\n\nScientific truths are complex. Understanding how an invisible, harmless gas can trap heat in the atmosphere because of its molecular shape is not easy. The claim that if a child gets ill shortly after being vaccinated, that doesn't mean the vaccine caused the illness, is counter-intuitive, as is -- conversely -- saying that just because someone gets better after taking homeopathy, that doesn't mean the homeopathy made them better.\n\nScience deals in uncertainty, and in often counter-intuitive fact.\n\n\"Climate change is not dangerous; it's a liberal hoax\" is a more reassuring message than \"climate change is real and going to make things much worse.\" It's also easier to understand. The only drawback is that it's false.\n\nThe public may have had enough of experts, but as the winter bushfires in Australia show, that doesn't mean the experts are wrong.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/20/opinions/populist-skeptics-science-opinion-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-08-20T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why Australians should be worried about Fraser Anning's words", "text": "Mohammad Al-Khafaji is the honorary secretary of the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Council of Australia .

It's hard to tell", "text": "Washington (CNN Business) President Donald Trump, who since the beginning of his political career has promised to stem the flow of jobs overseas, says his trade wars are doing just that.\n\n\"Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the US, including BMW, which just announced a major new plant. The USA. is booming!,\" the President tweeted this week.\n\nIs that really true?\n\nWell, maybe. But it's hard to tell definitively, because it turns out that offshoring \u2014 and \"reshoring,\" as the opposite effect of bringing jobs back into a country is known \u2014 is extremely difficult to measure with any precision.\n\nThe answer matters as Democrats line up to oppose Trump's newly signed replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and as he engages in a slow dance with Chinese leader Xi Jinping as well as European leaders over an array of trade issues at the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nWhat we do know: Manufacturing has been rebounding ever since the depths of the recession, with employment going from 11.5 million jobs in 2010 to nearly 12.8 million today. That happened for a number of reasons, including the rise of oil and gas fracking providing cheap energy and a glut of unemployed people willing to accept lower-wage jobs. Employers also face more risk in long global supply chains, and have shifted to a \"just-in-time\" manufacturing strategy that allows distributors to respond quickly to changing customer needs if their factories are on American soil.\n\nYet we also know that the trade balance in goods \u2014 the difference between what we import and what we export \u2014 has continued to widen under the Trump administration, reaching $77.2 billion in October, up from $67.7 billion at the beginning of his term and the second largest gap ever. That means American consumers and companies are buying more stuff from abroad that could be made in the US, such as automobiles\n\n\"It's still a two-way street,\" says Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which is backed by the United Steelworkers union and manufacturers. \"We still have manufacturing that is leaving the US, but you also see some reshoring.\"\n\nThere is one source of data that measures offshoring explicitly: Trade Adjustment Assistance, a federal subsidy that since 1975 has been available to workers who lose jobs when companies move work overseas or simply cut production due to competition from cheaper imports. Use of the program spiked during the recession, and then receded to more normal levels.\n\nThat's still not a perfect yardstick, however, since it's also influenced by how generous funding for the program is and how willing states are to certify applications. It's not very useful for real-time measurement, since application data is posted with a delay. Moreover, it misses the more gradual drift of production to other countries.\n\nSometimes it's easy to tell when a job has been offshored, like when furnace and air-conditioner maker Carrier said in 2016 it would move all the work in an Indiana plant to Mexico \u2014 a plan infamously, if only partially, reversed by Trump as president-elect.\n\nBut General Motors said this week it would shut down five North American plants, plus three others elsewhere in the world, as it shrinks its sedan business in favor of light trucks and SUVs.\n\nOther companies have similarly cited changing demand patterns. For example, United Technologies is currently winding down operations at its aerospace plant in Chula Vista, California that it bought in 2012, which will result in the loss of more than 300 jobs. The company says that the aircraft components that had been made there since the 1950s simply weren't selling anymore.\n\n\"We haven't found anything that's feasible in that location,\" says Stacey MacNeil, vice president of communications for UTC Aerospace Systems, the division that operates the plant.\n\nThe union that represents those workers says it's hard to believe that a plant that once employed more than 10,000 workers could shrink to almost nothing over the course of three decades, while Mexico's aerospace industry boomed.\n\n\"Companies do this all the time,\" says Owen Herrnstadt, chief of staff at the International Association of Machinists. \"They outsource work, invest elsewhere, leave some work on programs that are ending\u2014and then shut down saying the program ended, instead of investing in the US plant in the first place, which could keep US workers employed on new programs.\"\n\nAnd as part of its effort to pull jobs back to the US through an overhaul of NAFTA, American negotiators persuaded Mexico to accept a provision that would require that at least 40% of imported vehicles to be made by workers who earn more than $16 an hour. That might ease the wage differential that makes it so appealing for automakers to move production south of the border, but would prove very difficult to enforce.\n\n\"I would think that on the Mexican side they're thinking 'this is going to be so hard to implement that we're not giving that much up,'\" says Gordon Hanson, an economics professor at the University of California-San Diego.\n\nSo far, from the Mexican side of the border, it doesn't look like offshoring has slowed down. Eduardo Saavedra is vice president for business development at the Offshore Group, which provides contract manufacturing in Mexico for mostly US-based clients, and says that business has only continued to increase under the Trump administration.\n\n\"Among our clients, we haven't met with people who are concerned with the rhetoric coming from the White House,\" Saavedra says.\n\nAnd of course, there's another factor: American companies have to react to other countries' retaliatory tariffs, too.\n\nIn a survey of 800 manufacturers conducted in mid-October by IHS Markit, respondents on average said that the new US tariffs and escalating trade war would make them slightly more likely to move production overseas over the next two years. The exceptions? Metal goods and mechanical engineering firms.\n\nNow, there is some evidence that increased offshore activity by US multinational companies can actually raise net employment in America \u2014 but only slightly, and with lots of job disruption along the way.\n\nThat's why the labor-backed worker advocacy group Good Jobs Nation has been pushing Trump to lean on large federal contractors like United Technologies and Boeing by dinging them in the procurement process if they manufacture outside the US.\n\nManufacturing experts say that in many cases manufacturers go overseas simply because they can't find enough workers to fill the jobs they have. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there were a record high 506,000 manufacturing jobs open in the U.S. in August.\n\n\"From an employer's perspective, there is a huge shortage of labor,\" says Scott Jacobs, executive director of the Great Lakes Trade Adjustment Assistance Center, which assists firms that have been hurt by imports. \"One of the things that would really help manufacturers is an even greater focus on trying to provide communities with assistance to really help colleges or companies themselves develop training programs.\"\n\nto locate production outside the US.

Unwanted visitors would be added to the list when a homeowner tags them as not authorized. Other people could be added to the database because they are a convicted felon or registered sex offender, according to the application. Residents may also alert neighbors of a suspicious person's presence.\n\nBut some people, such as a mail courier, could be placed on an authorized persons list. Postal service logos could be used to help identify them.\n\nRead More\n\nThe patent describes the neighborhood surveillance system as an opt-in service. Some critics expressed concern to CNN Business about the implications of the broad use of facial recognition technology. \"The patent is a roadmap for Amazon's disturbing vision of surveillance in the future,\" Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told CNN Business. \"People have the right to go about their daily lives without being watched and tracked. And there's no assurance the resolution of the doorbell camera is very good.\" This summer, the ACLU tested the software and showed that it inaccurately identified some members of Congress as criminals. Amazon declined to comment for this article. But in the past, the company has said its policy prohibits the use of its service for activities that are illegal, violate the rights of others, or may be harmful. The patent's inventor is listed as Jamie Siminoff, CEO of Ring, which Amazon acquired earlier this year Companies often patent ideas that never come to fruition. But Amazon has shown a willingness to use facial recognition technology elsewhere. In May, Amazon announced a social network called Neighbors, which was created for sharing photos and videos of burglars, suspicious activity and package thieves. The technology described in the patent could make the platform more powerful. Amazon's competitors in the home security space have already embraced facial recognition technology. Some of Google's cameras, including the Nest Hello and Nest Cam IQ, already identify faces and identify users. Meanwhile, French startup Netatmo sells an indoor camera that uses facial recognition technology. 9 top tech gifts to give this year Amazon seems aware of some of the technology's current limitations. The patent application details how it may be difficult to get a clear photo of a person's face, but it also describes the value of sharing data with other neighbors. If multiple cameras capture the same person, the images could be stitched together to create a composite image. The composite image may be sent to the homeowner's smartphone, according to the application. According to Matt Pruitt, chief solutions architect at NEC, which develops facial recognition technology, Amazon's algorithms would benefit from a mass deployment of the technology. Amazon cameras would regularly capture people entering their homes, allowing it to test and improve on how well it identifies people. He expected the potential surveillance of neighborhoods to be limited to front porches, as the doorbell cameras lack the power to identify people farther away on sidewalks or streets. \"Smart city or surveillance state are two sides of the same coin,\" Pruitt said. \"Technology in itself is neither good or bad.

Following Carlos Ghosn's downfall, they are in danger of extinction.\n\nGhosn, a French citizen who was born in Brazil of Lebanese descent, was credited with leading a stunning turnaround at Nissan ( NSANY ) after he took over as CEO in 2001.His reign at the carmaker was celebrated as one of the few examples of a foreigner successfully running a big Japanese company.\n\nThat all changed with his arrest last week on suspicion of serious financial misconduct and subsequent dismissal as chairman of Nissan and Mitsubishi ( MMTOF ), another Japanese automaker.\n\n\"It will be a lot harder for foreigners to land CEO gigs [in future],\" said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan in Tokyo.\n\nGeorge Olcott, a guest professor at Tokyo's Keio University who has sat on the boards of several big Japanese companies, said foreigners are usually only appointed \"as a last resort.\"\n\nIn the case of Ghosn, it was the prospect of bankruptcy that prompted Nissan to hire him. Having rescued Renault, Ghosn had a track record of taking tough decisions to cut costs and lay off workers, which Japanese executives have historically been reluctant to do. It paid off for Nissan.\n\nThat's not always been the case with other foreign bosses in Japan. Michael Woodford's brief term as CEO of electronics maker Olympus ended after he questioned fraudulent practices at the company in 2011, while Howard Stringer's tenure at tech conglomerate Sony ( SNE ) coincided with an extended period of poor earnings.\n\n'Organ rejection'\n\nExperts point out that Japanese companies are often run in ways that are unfamiliar to executives from Europe or the United States.\n\nThe top managers have typically been with the company since graduation, as many Japanese workers are reluctant to switch employers. This breeds a distinct corporate culture, which can make it hard for outsiders \u2014 even Japanese executives from other companies \u2014 to fit in.\n\nForeign bosses are often only appointed as a last resort in Japan.\n\n\"It's like organ rejection,\" said Nicholas Benes, representative director at the Board Director Training Institute of Japan. Foreign executives \"often don't get accepted by the recipient host.\" Benes, an American, has worked in Japan for more than two decades.\n\nIn Japan, recruiting from outside the company is rare. CEOs are often hired based on how long they've been with the company, rather than because of their skills. \"It doesn't make much difference in many cases if your performance was really good or really bad,\" Benes added.\n\n'Take the money and run'\n\nHigh pay touches a raw nerve in Japan, where foreign executives have a reputation for demanding much bigger salaries than their local peers. One of the allegations against Ghosn is that he didn't report all of his income properly.High pay touches a raw nerve in Japan, where foreign executives have a reputation for demanding much bigger salaries than their local peers.\n\n\"There's a sense they're there to make hay while the sun shines and will take the money and run when things go badly,\" said Keio University's Olcott. The perception could increase with Ghosn's downfall, he added.\n\nBenes points out that executive salaries in Japan are generally lower than in the United States, which made Ghosn's reported Nissan salary of about $9.7 million in 2017 stand out.\n\nWelsh-born Howard Stringer was CEO of Sony until 2012.\n\nJapanese companies also prefer CEOs who don't take credit for successes and keep a low profile, experts say. Ghosn didn't fit that mold. He was a regular at World Economic Forum meetings and threw lavish wedding parties\n\n\"He nurtured hero worship and took too much credit for positive developments,\" said Temple University's Kingston. That clashed with a \"culture that values discretion and humility.\"\n\n'Globalize and compete'\n\nDespite their dwindling numbers, there are still a few foreign executives occupying top jobs in Japan Inc.\n\n( Christophe Weber, the French head of pharmaceutical maker Takeda TKPYY ), is now the country's most prominent non-Japanese boss.\n\nWeber is spearheading the company's $62 billion acquisition of Shire ( SHPG ), based in Ireland. The deal has drawn criticism from some Japanese investors, who think it's too risky for Takeda, which was founded in 1781.\n\nBut it is bold moves such as these that Japanese companies need to try if they are to thrive in the future. With Japan's economy stuck in a deep rut , and facing further headwinds such as a rapidly aging society, they need to be able to compete globally.\n\n\"Japan needs more foreign CEOs and other executives to globalize and compete,\" said Benes at the Board Director Training Institute. \"That's an essential requirement that won't change.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/business/japan-foreign-ceos-carlos-ghosn/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Chinese tech companies will now keep detailed records of users' activity", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN Business) Chinese internet companies have started keeping detailed records of their users' personal information and online activity.\n\nThe new requirements apply to any company that provides online services which can influence public opinion or \"mobilize the public to engage in specific activities,\" according to a notice posted on the Cyber Administration of China's website earlier this month.\n\nCompanies will now have to start logging the activities of users posting in blogs, microblogs, chat rooms, short video platforms and webcasts.\n\nCiting the need to safeguard national security and social order, the Chinese regulator said companies must be able to verify users' identities and keep records of key information such as call logs, chat logs, times of activity and network addresses.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/tech/china-internet-regulation/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Business trips without all the stress", "text": "(CNN Business) For frequent business travelers, the vagaries of life on the road are both part of the allure and part of the job. While you may enjoy exploring new locations and boosting your frequent flier status, be sure to also pay attention to your physical and mental health.\n\nBusiness travelers who spend more than 14 days a month on the road are significantly more likely to report depression, anxiety, alcohol dependence and sleep problems, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Occupational Health.\n\n\"The negative health effects really seem to pile up at the two-week mark,\" says Dr. Andrew Rundle, lead author of the 2018 study and a professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University.\n\nTo counteract these effects, it's important to take time for yourself, experts advise. So don't feel guilty about hitting the gym, catching up with friends in the area, seeing the sites, booking that spa appointment or just meditating or relaxing when the workday's done.\n\n\"Business travelers need to develop healthy habits just for the road,\" says Rundle.\n\nAmsterdam's Schipol Airport has a meditation space.\n\nRead More\n\nWhen facing a busy schedule of important client meetings and decadent business lunches, of course, that can be a challenge. Before you start your trip, protect against overscheduling by marking off time on your calendar to exercise or relax each day, advises Dr. Robert L. Quigley, senior vice president and regional medical director of MedAire's International SOS Assistance Inc., a medical and travel security risk services company. Then honor those commitments to your health. Working out during your travels will help you eat more nutritiously, and sleep more soundly, even when you're crossing time zones, experts say. Dr. Rundle, who travels often for his job will find a way to bake physical activity into his day even if he can't get to a hotel gym. \"I'm the person standing at the back of the conference -- standing burns much more energy than being completely sedentary,\" he says. \"If I have a meeting, I'll suggest a walk rather than sitting on the couch in the hotel lobby.\" You'll feel more motivated to keep up healthy habits if you regularly connect with friends and family at home. Text a friend, call your cousin, video chat with your spouse or post a few photos on social media, experts advise. Take a moment periodically to notice how you're feeling and what you're doing, recommends Allison Forti, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Wake Forest University Department of Counseling. \"When you travel a lot, you can get into autopilot, and start doing things and not know why, like eating the same big meal at the same restaurant, or not talking to your partner,\" says Forti. If you start to feel stressed, just knowing that's a common reaction to work travel can help keep symptoms at bay. Take a deep breath, be mindful, and show extra kindness to yourself. And give yourself permission to have fun.

For millions of others, credit card numbers and card expiration dates were potentially compromised. This kind of information could be used to steal your identity and open bank accounts, credit cards or loans in your name.\n\nIt's the second biggest corporate data breach in history, behind one involving Yahoo, which said last year that 3 billion accounts among several of its brands were compromised.\n\nMarriott said it will start emailingusers who were impacted and it has set up a website with information about the breach.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what you can do to protect yourself:\n\nChange your password\n\nMarriott says guests should change their passwords regularly and pick ones that aren't easily guessed. For example, instead of a common phrase, choose a combination of four or more unrelated words with numbers, characters and a mix of upper and lower-case letters.\n\nYou should also have different passwords for all the services you use.\n\n\"Changing your password will just add one more roadblock to a potential hacker getting into your system,\" said Aaron Brantly, a cybersecurity expert at Virginia Tech.\n\nMany websites, including social media and financial accounts, offer two-factor authentication for an added layer of security. Even if someone obtains your password, you can't access your accounts without a second piece of information, like a code texted to your phone.\n\nMonitor your accounts for suspicious activity\n\nMarriott recommends customers keep an eye on their Starwood Preferred Guest account for any suspicious activity. Guests should also check their bank, retirement, and brokerage accounts, as well as credit card statements to look for any unauthorized transactions.\n\nSome experts recommend signing up for credit monitoring services or identity theft protection. A more extreme step is putting a freeze on your credit, which blocks anyone from accessing your credit reports without permission.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the reality is [these consumers] have to monitor continuously, for generally the rest of their lives,\" said Brantly. \"These types of accounts are sold regularly on the dark web. ... You can usually buy credit card information for a couple dollars per credit card online.\"\n\nVivek Lakshman, VP of innovation at cybersecurity firm ThumbSignIn, says consumers can also enroll in services like WebWatcher -- which Marriott is providing for free for a year -- to track their exposure. These sites monitor websites where personal information is shared and alerts consumers if there's evidence of their information exposed online.\n\nOpen a separate credit card for online transactions\n\nYair Levy, a cybersecurity and information systems expert at Nova Southeastern University, recommends having a credit card dedicated to online shopping. This makes it easier to track transactions and spot fraudulent activity.\n\nIf that credit card is compromised, you also won't have to update automatic payments for things like bills.\n\nLimit the information you share\n\nExperts say not to provide information unless it's absolutely required to buy a product or service.\n\n\"Consumers should limit what they provide companies based on their need to know. Often, companies gather data that they may not need, but take if volunteered,\" said Marty Puranik, the CEO of Atlantic.Net, a cloud computing and hosting services provider.\n\nFor example, a travel company may ask for passport information, but it may not be required. If it is, you can ask what other forms of identification you can provide instead.\n\n\"If you give lower level information, or information that can be changed -- for example, a second credit card to verify your identity -- it is easier to change and protect that then a social security number or passport ID,\" he said.\n\nBut this isn't always possible. If you are traveling internationally, a company like Marriott may require a passport number.\n\nAvoid saving credit card information on websites\n\nExperts recommend minimizing the number of places where you store credit card information. However, this doesn't mean your data will be safe or protected -- it just helps cut down on the risk.\n\nAnother option is to use services such as PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay, which let you pay for goods and services without divulging your credit card to the company you're buying from.\n\nBe vigilant\n\nConsumers should work under the assumption cyber criminals already have access to their information as breaches become increasingly common.\n\n\"Having a very healthy dose of skepticism moving forward is probably the best way to safeguard yourself in an era where all your information has been divulged, unfortunately,\" said Brantly.\n\nExperts caution internet users to be wary of \"phishing\" attempts by bad actors looking to steal your data, including through bogus emails, fake links and fraudulent websites. On its informational website about the hack, Marriott reminded members the company will not ask you to provide your password by phone or email.\n\n\"Know you are consistently being exposed [and] consistently under threat -- not necessarily through any fault of your own but accidental disclosures by companies or carelessness by companies. It requires us in the modern era to be vigilant consistently,\" said Brantly.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/tech/marriott-breach-what-to-do/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The hidden costs of commuting while female", "text": "(CNN) There's the wage gap, the bonus gap, the promotions gap \u2014 and then there's the commuting gap.\n\nNew research shows that even when it comes to negotiating the distance between work and home, men and women inhabit different realities. For many men, the commute to work is a fact of life, something non-negotiable and relatively uncomplicated \u2014 a pain, maybe, but a mere part of the workday.\n\nBut for many women, the daily commute is loaded with difficult decisions. They may choose where they live or work to intentionally shorten their commutes, in order to meet a multitude of homemaking and caregiving responsibilities. If a job requires commuting at night or alone, some women spend more money on taxis or ride shares using services like Uber and Lyft.\n\nBecause of these added costs, women might decide some commutes just aren't worth it. They may forgo a job -\u2014 and its wages \u2014 altogether.\n\nCommuting while female\n\nSarah Kaufman, of New York University's Rudin Center for Transportation , says two things affect women's commuting considerations. She found many New York women spent hundreds of dollars each year on ridesharing apps and taxi services, both for convenience (think about carrying a stroller up and down subway steps) and for personal safety (think also about waiting on that same subway late at night, alone).\n\n\"Even though there aren't these huge incidents on transportation systems, there are daily interactions that can also wear down on a person, much like workplace harassment might,\" Kaufman says. \"There are things that can really impact someone's self-worth or general level of comfort in their day-to-day lives.\"\n\nWomen in low-income industries, often juggle work in remote places with shifts in the early morning or late evening. If they don't have a vehicle, they're reliant on public transportation, which brings a whole new set of potential encounters with harassment, catcalling or worse.\n\nWomen in these situations may avoid a job altogether for fear of a potentially dangerous commute, says Evelyn Blumenberg, professor of urban planning at the University of California in Los Angeles.\n\n\"A lot of those actual and perceived fears influence the likelihood that a woman is even going to use public transit,\" Blumenberg says. \"So it's off-peak hours, say nighttime when the bus doesn't come very often \u2014 there's lots of fears about security, about hanging out at a bus stop. You're likely to not take that trip, which may have economic consequences.\"\n\nThe caregiver's commute\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Office of National Statistics found women have much shorter commute times than their male partners. At first glance, this seems like a good thing \u2014 until you consider the other responsibilities that necessitate women being that much closer to the home.\n\n\"I think it really fits into what we know about parenting,\" says Ariane Hegewisch, research director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research. \"If you're a parent, you're really held to a tight schedule, which means you take into account things like 'Can I be back at 5:30 or 6 to pick the kid up from childcare?' and we also know a lot of the highest-paying jobs in the US need you to be very fungible with time, if not always available.\"\n\nFor this reason, Hegewisch says, many women have to make compromises when it comes to their career. Especially in high-paying fields like law and finance, promotions come from working long hours and weekends, or even offering to be \"on call\" at all times. This is something outside the realm of possibility for many caregivers who are already juggling responsibilities at home with those on the job.\n\n\"You basically cannot be late if you're a parent,\" Hegewisch says. \"You're held to a tight schedule.\"\n\nThe irony, Hegewisch points out, is that ideally once an employee puts in the time and makes the compromises \u2014 all to reach tenure or make partner, for example \u2014 they can then control their time with some sense of authority.\n\nBut for many women battling commute times and other hurdles blocking their path to success, that control comes too late to make a difference.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/success/women-commuting-gap/index.html", "published": "2018-11-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Facebook's top exec in India: We must build 'a safe environment'", "text": "New Delhi (CNN Business) Facebook ( FB ) has more users in India than any other country.

Facebook has since made several changes to the app.\n\nAnkhi Das is Facebook's public policy director for India and South Asia and its top executive in New Delhi (until a new India managing director starts in early 2019.)\n\nDas spoke to CNN Business this month about some of the biggest challenges and opportunities. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat India means to Facebook\n\nIndia is a very, very big priority for us company wide. It has leadership attention of an extremely high order.\n\nI am extremely bullish ... in terms of opportunity and the diversity that our country offers for any internet platform to be successful, and particularly our platform because we are all about community and India is a very community-centered country.\n\nThe future is already here as far as India is concerned. It's not the future of internet which will come at some point of time, it's already here.\n\nFacebook has more users in India than any other country.\n\nIndian languages and their potential\n\nI think our main area of work where we have to do a lot more is making sure that our language localization moves much farther and faster. A lot of the internet consumption is happening in local languages.\n\nFacebook is already available in 11 Indian languages but we do anticipate that that is a momentum that will continue to grow.\n\nThe importance of video\n\nVideo is a big priority for us company wide, and in India, too, it is a very big priority. We have a large business partnerships team which is looking into this and working with our ... product teams to make sure that India continues to be a very big focus.\n\nWe do think that video consumption is going to increase in a variety of ways, for a variety of needs, from entertainment to politics to news.\n\nDigital literacy and fighting abuse\n\nA lot of the people who are coming online in the next phase of growth are going to be first time internet users. Therefore our ability to make sure that people have the tools to understand what are safe internet practices [is] going to be a very important area of work.\n\nI think the stability and growth of the internet is all going to be driven by how safe people feel on the internet.\n\nThere is the dark side to the internet as well. You have to make sure that you are enforcing against those bad actors so that they go away and don't stay on the platform, and we are working on that.\n\nWe have a lot of rural users who are coming online for the first time. Making sure that they can teach themselves how to keep safe is something that we are highly invested in.\n\nWe are very, very committed to abuse prevention of any form. In India the situation is particularly acute with regard to gender ... and as we look to our next generation. I look at it from the perspective both as an Indian and as a south Asian woman and as a mother.\n\nWe will have to make sure that the next phase of growth and online users ... many of them women and children, have a safe environment to engage.\n\nFake news and misinformation\n\nFighting fake news and misinformation is a constant process and something where everybody ... has to share a load and carry some responsibility.\n\nWhen people are consuming content they have to have the capacity to distinguish what is fake and what is true. I think there is a capacity gap and we have a responsibility to address that gap, and that is what we are doing.\n\nTechnology is a platform but a lot of the stuff that we are seeing is societal, and therefore we have to work together to make sure that there is a product resolution but also that there is a community resolution in terms of shaping behaviors.\n\nYou can't say ... fake news will never happen. It's such a menace in any society. But you must have a very strong containment strategy.\n\nWomen using the internet\n\nI think what is happening now is that women have the tools which makes it easier for them to start a business, build market access, recognition and build a viable business.\n\nThey are also creating employment for other women. So we are seeing a lot of that work happening. It's not just about them creating viable businesses but also lifting other women, getting them to enter the workforce, and that is uplifting. When you have economic power at home you have negotiation power too.\n\nIndia's upcoming elections\n\nThe first element is maintaining elections integrity, which means that we are going to enforce policies. We are going to be very strict in terms of enforcing against fake accounts.\n\nSo we are going to be doing a close hard look in terms of enforcing against fakes and other activities.\n\nOur goal now is to educate [political] parties about ... what is allowed on the platform and what is not.\n\nGovernment regulations\n\nWe as a company across the board respect privacy regulation. And we think this is long overdue, India needs a data protection law.\n\nWhat is challenging and problematic is the trends which we are seeing around data localization. If you look at the history of globalization, the first phase was about globalization of capital, the current phase is about globalization of data.\n\nDigitalization is global in character, it's not insular.

It involves your lawn.\n\nDandelion, born in the secretive and futuristic lab \"X\" of Google's parent company Alphabet, uses energy from the ground to cool and heat your home. It announced its first commercial product on Wednesday: a smart heating and air conditioning system called Dandelion Air.\n\nAlthough heating and cooling systems aren't innately sexy, Dandelion is banking on an eco-friendly method to make heating and AC costs lower for homeowners.\n\nRather than relying on furnaces and traditional AC systems, Dandelion Air is a geothermal system that uses the ground's energy via plastic pipes and a pump in the home. The systems move heat from the ground into the house in the winter, and heat from the house into the ground in the summer.\n\nGeothermal systems reduce carbon dioxide emissions and help save consumers money on energy bills.\n\nHow the geothermal system works.\n\nRead More\n\nThe concept has been around for decades, but because of its high price and inability to monitor performance over time, adoption has been relatively slow. \"It's a very niche technology that hasn't taken off at all in this country,\" Dandelion CEO Kathy Hannun, a former Google employee, told CNN. Hannun's team at Google's X division sought to make geothermal technology more accessible. X is known for its \"moonshots,\" or big ideas intended to change the world, including self-driving car company Waymo and \"Project Loon\" Wi-Fi balloons. The team worked on the technology for about two years at Google before becoming its own company. Traditionally, geothermal systems are custom made for homes. But Dandelion wanted to automate the manufacturing process and make the system work with every home. \"One thing we looked for at X was adding technology to an industry that hasn't benefited [from tech],\" Hannun said. \"I started working on it part-time. About two-thirds of the year in [we realized], 'There's something here. Let's focus on it.'\" The startup claims Dandelion Air is four times more efficient than furnaces, and almost twice as efficient as traditional air conditioning systems. It also comes with a Nest learning thermostat and a monitoring system to track its performance. The Dandelion Air system. Athough it's half the cost of other geothermal systems, it's far from cheap -- installation costs about $20,000, depending on home size. Considering the Dandelion Air homeowner is expected to save about 20% annually on the cost of heating and cooling their home, the startup hopes this is reason enough for homeowners to go geothermal for new or existing homes. \"Homeowners are so used to not having a choice with how they heat [their home],\" Hannun said. \"But that's what we bring: a choice.\" The company already attracted early attention from investors, too -- it doesn't hurt to have started at Google. In April, Dandelion said it raised a fresh $4.5 million in funding. Despite upfront costs, Jefferson Tester -- a professor of sustainable energy systems at Cornell University -- says geothermal systems are quiet, more efficient and use less electricity. \"Maintenance is also very low, which could be attractive for a homeowner,\" he said. \"There's a huge variability in the cost of geothermal systems. A more standardized approach [like Dandelion's] could be quite attractive.\" The company ran a six-month pilot program in the Hudson Valley and Capital Districts in New York, and sold 70 systems in existing homes last year. With the official launch of Dandelion Air, the systems will be available in most of New York State starting Wednesday. But geothermal systems may not be a fit for everyone. In states with low electricity costs, a simple AC unit may be cheaper. It can also depend on the type of home someone lives in, according to Tester. \"This isn't like buying a refrigerator. [Geothermal] has a lot of custom work that needs to be done in the house,\" said Tester. \"All old homes aren't the same.\" Customers can check if their home qualifies on Dandelion's website", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/dandelion-air-google/index.html", "published": "2018-10-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Virgin Galactic may (finally) make space tourism reality", "text": "CNN's Rachel Crane gets an exclusive look inside Virgin Galactic as the team attempts to become the first private company to send an astronaut to space.\n\nSource: CNN Business", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/30/virgin-galactic-christmas-orig.cnn-business", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Branson talks Brexit, Saudi Arabia and peace in space", "text": "In an exclusive interview with CNN's Rachel Crane, Richard Branson talks about President Trump's Space Force and why Brexit is the worst thing for Britain since WWII.\n\nSource: CNN Business", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2018/11/30/richard-branson-politics.cnn-business", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Inside China's biggest gadget market", "text": "Most of the world's consumer electronics are produced in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

They're also the ones who are typically tasked with recruiting more diverse candidates. They're usually the ones tapped to speak up in uncomfortable discussions about company culture.\n\nIn short, they're the ones doing the hard work of making a workplace more diverse, inclusive and welcoming to everyone.\n\n\"Especially if you're a woman of color or visibly queer, you will be burdened or assigned or expected to take on that diversity work,\" says Veronica Caridad Cruz Rabelo, assistant professor of management at San Francisco State University.\n\nThis \"double shift\" is common in many workplaces.

Meeting with other employees of color, for example, isn't something that is typically recognized in employee evaluations, and speaking up against sexism in a meeting isn't often part of a promotion track. People from the majority group may not even recognize it as \"labor\" that detracts from time that could be spent on other work responsibilities. \"I'm not going to be promoted for doing this emotional labor,\" G\u00f3mez says. \"There just isn't enough time in the day or enough time in my brain to do all these things. I get tired.\" Where it starts \u2014 and stops Those from the majority group may think they're doing the right thing by turning the work over to people of color, LGBT employees and other workers who belong to a minority group. They don't want to take up space in the room \u2014 but in avoiding the conversation altogether, they're also not taking the time to be an ally '\"Well-meaning' whites want to address these issues, and i think the one thing where this needs to start is really listening,\" says Rebecca Erickson, sociology professor at the University of Akron. \"This requires a safe space.\" Their intentions may be good, but in neglecting to share their responsibility, they're only perpetuating the problem. How diverse should diversity be? Erickson suggests organizations keep the power differential in mind: an employee may feel uncomfortable explaining to their manager that the responsibility is being shared unfairly. First of all, supervisors need to listen and learn without, for example, relying on people of color to educate them on racism in the workplace. Managers should bring in people from human resources or even outside firms, suggests Erickson. This way, the manager gets a chance to learn alongside everyone else, and the other employes aren't distracted from their work with requests to do the heavy lifting.

Are they a good way to structure my charitable giving while getting tax benefits?\n\nA donor advised fund is a relatively simple, flexible and tax-efficient way to grow your investments and give to charity.\n\nThink of it as a dedicated account for your charitable giving. It allows you to contribute cash, securities or other assets to the fund and get an immediate tax deduction. You maintain control of your investments, which grow tax-free since they are charitable donations, and make grants to the IRS-qualified charity you choose.\n\nYou can open a fund with as little as $5,000. All the money you put in goes to charity (once it's in, you're not getting it back), but you get an immediate tax break. Deciding how the money gets distributed is up to you: dole out $2,000 every year to a bunch of different charities, for example, make a significant gift of a $1 million ten years from now, or create a fund as a legacy for your children to continue to distribute after your death.\n\n\"Donor advised funds are one of my go-to strategies for reducing taxes for people who are already charitable,\" says Patrick King, a certified financial planner with Transformative Financial.\n\nRead More\n\nHere's how to figure out if a donor advised fund is the best way to accomplish your giving goals. The benefits Opening a fund is relatively easy. You can do it through many public charities such as Fidelity Charitable Schwab Charitable , the National Philanthrapic Trust or a community foundation. You just need a Social Security number and at least $5,000 to invest, though some charities may have higher minimums. If you donate cash, you're eligible for a tax deduction of up to 60% of your adjusted gross income. But the real appeal of donor advised funds for many investors is that they might accept a wide variety of donations \u2014 including publicly traded securities, restricted stock, mutual fund shares, cryptocurrencies, private equity and hedge fund interest, real estate or privately held C-corp or S-corp shares \u2014 that charities often cannot accept. \"Donor advised funds have gotten to a place where they can take more complex assets,\" says Tina Davis Milligan, managing director of family office services at BMO wealth management. \"A lot of clients have large capital gains and they may give more than they planned because it becomes more meaningful.\" This is where investors can find very favorable double tax benefits. If you give these appreciated assets directly to a donor advised fund, you can, first, avoid paying capital gains tax and, second, take an additional income tax deduction in the amount of the full fair market value of the asset, up to 30% of your adjusted gross income. A donor advised fund could make a great deal of sense right before retirement, says Michael Troxell, an investment adviser and certified public accountant with Modern Financial Planning. \"While a near-retiree is still working and in a high tax bracket, they could contribute a large amount of charitable giving (say 10-20 years worth) to a DAF in order to maximize the tax benefit while being able to distribute the funds to charitable organizations over the course of their retirement,\" says Troxell. A good time to establish or add money to your fund is after a significant swell in assets \u2014 maybe a retirement payout, an unusually high bonus or the sale of a company. \"When a client has a big year, a donor advised fund can 'front load' their charitable giving for future years while providing a large charitable deduction in the year they need it most,\" says King. The pitfalls Like any investment, the value of a donor advised fund fluctuates. Don't get in over your head with a fund that includes costly or risky investments, says Dan Stous, the director of financial planning at Flagstone Financial Management. Another mistake is opening a DAF with a high-cost provider. \"There may be some premium services offered by some providers to justify a fee, like acting as a consultant to connect the giver with charities in their community, or talking through complex gifting situations, but givers should know what they're paying, and know what they're getting for that fee.\" But the biggest pitfall with a DAF is to simply view it as an investment or tax-reduction vehicle, says Stous. \"Ultimately, donor advised funds are a way to give to charity,\" he says. \"If your primary reason for putting money in a fund is something other than a generous heart, you're setting yourself up for disappointment.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/success/donor-advised-funds/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Audi reveals the E-Tron GT.

And once they pivot and start going down that road, they can find that person.\" DNA phenotyping is different from traditional DNA profiling, which relies on matching the relevant DNA from a crime scene with DNA that has been obtained from potential individuals. With DNA phenotyping, a match isn't being made so the relevant DNA is used on its own without having to compare it to DNA that's been collected beforehand and is in the system. \"We're essentially bringing in entirely new ways to analyze forensic DNA,\" Greytak said. Police departments have used the technology to make an identification of the female victim and then arrest her killer. \"The traditional forensic DNA analysis looks just at, 'Can this DNA from a crime scene be matched to a suspect we've already identified or to a database?' And it's great for that, but if you don't find a match, it couldn't tell you anything else. We can generate leads just from the DNA that's at that crime scene.\" Parabon said the information it predicts is generally observable by the public, such as eye and hair color. When it uses geneaology information, it relies on public databases, such as Ancestry.com. But some experts say accessing DNA and genetic information in this way, and the predictive nature of the technology, is a cause for concern. Arthur Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU's Department of Population Health, said \"the consent isn't as explicit and clear as it needs to be.\" He said people in public geneaology databases may not realize that it's being used in this way. But he said there are fewer concerns over the use of DNA. \"DNA privacy is very flimsy,\" he said. \"You're leaking your DNA everywhere you go. In part it's ethical because DNA is left all over the place. It'd be another thing to come into your house and approach your bed when you're asleep and try to get a swab out of your mouth.\" He noted gathering DNA from blood found outside of someone's home isn't that different from getting DNA from a discarded cigarette butt or coffee cup. While he said the science isn't yet 100% accurate, he noted that it's only going to get better as the science and understanding of genomes improves. \"There's all kinds of info lurking in our genes,\" he said. \"Not everything is there but a lot.\" There are already some clear limitations. The composites can't reveal an individual's age and they can't lead directly to a conviction on their own, but similar to a mug shot, it may help police narrow their search. Still Greytak hopes the technology will help law enforcement solve active cases faster and cut down on the number of existing cold cases. \"Cases won't have to go cold,\" Greytak said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/tech/dna-cold-cases-technology/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Trump administration proposes changes to popular H-1B program", "text": "The Department of Homeland Security released a proposal Friday that would increase the number of H-1B visa recipients who have master's degrees or higher level degrees and would move the registration process online.\n\nThe government has been working to crack down on the H-1B program \u2014 a result of President Donald Trump's direction that agencies implement a \"Buy American, Hire American\" strategy.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a work visa that's valid for three years and can be renewed for another three years.

As part of that deal, Amazon agreed to prohibit unauthorized third-parties from selling Apple goods on its site, a deal that angered some independent sellers and iPhone repair companies.\n\nApple and Amazon are still competitors, however.

The multimedia series went inside Richard Branson's Virgin empire and premiered live from Mojave, California, on November 30, 2018.\n\nMojave, California (CNN Business) Four years ago, a co-pilot was killed during a Virgin Galactic test flight. The tragedy left the future in doubt for the space tourism company and derailed its plans to begin commercial flights to the edge of space.\n\nHundreds of people had already reserved tickets that cost between $200,000 and $250,000. Some people lost their nerve and canceled their reservations.\n\nBut over the last few years, Virgin Galactic has righted itself. It has debuted an upgraded design of its rocket-powered plane, SpaceShipTwo, the first of which is called VSS Unity. Pilots conducted its first powered test flights earlier this year \u2014 the strongest indication yet that the company is nearing commercial operations.\n\n\"I've been so proud of the [Virgin Galactic] team, how they've responded to [the tragedy] and really moved forward with a sense of urgency,\" Virgin Galactic CEO George Whitesides told CNN Business' Rachel Crane.\n\n\"We're about to enter into sort of the highest and fastest part of our flight test program,\" he said. Galactic will conduct test flights that reach its goal altitude, more than 50 miles above Earth. \"Then we'll be in a position where we could be doing commercial service,\" Whitesides said.\n\nBranson himself plans to be the first passenger to hitch a ride aboard VSS Unity.\n\nExactly when passenger trips will begin is unclear. Branson, who has often touted deadlines that aren't met, told CNN Business on Wednesday that he is \"pretty confident\" VSS Unity's first flight to space will be \"before Christmas.\"\n\nOrbital flight\n\nThe startup also has its eyes on the moon and beyond.\n\nExecutives says Virgin Galactic wants to eventually compete with the likes of SpaceX on more difficult and dangerous space travel goals.\n\n\"I'm talking about, potentially, orbital flight or even staying a week on a space station or going around the moon,\" Whitesides, the CEO, told CNN Business. \"Or going even farther than that.\"\n\nOrbital flights, which require faster speeds and specific trajectories, are not in Virgin Galactic's near-term future. The company's current spaceship isn't capable of such a trek.\n\nBut Virgin Galactic executives told CNN Business they one day could work with Virgin Galactic's sister company \u2014 Virgin Orbit, which is focused on launching small satellites \u2014 to develop new human flight capabilities.\n\nVirgin Orbit plans to use a lightweight rocket that will launch mid-air from under the wing of a Boeing 747 to send up groups of satellites, some small enough to fit in the palm of your hand. Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart told CNN Business recently that he expects Orbit's first mission to be underway by the \"early part of next year.\"\n\n\"When a Virgin Orbit [rocket] goes into space, it'll be traveling at 18 and a half thousand miles an hour around the Earth,\" Branson said. \"Going from there to then putting people into orbit should be ... a relatively sensible next step.\"\n\nThree minutes in zero gravity\n\nGalactic's core technology is the brainchild of Burt Rutan, an eccentric aerospace engineer who teamed up with Paul Allen , the late co-founder of Microsoft, to form Scaled Composites. In 2004, their SpaceShipOne won the $10 million Ansari X Prize, a cash-prize competition meant to spur innovation, by making two crewed trips to space within two weeks.\n\nVirgin Galactic has since spearheaded the effort to adapt the technology for commercial flights.\n\nThis is how it will work: A carrier plane, called WhiteKnightTwo \u2014 it looks like two jets flying side by side, fused together at their wings \u2014 takes off from a runway carrying SpaceShipTwo. At about 50,000 feet the mothership releases SpaceShipTwo, and the rocket-powered plane free falls for a few seconds. Then the pilot fires the engine, heaving the craft further into the sky at three times the speed of sound.\n\nAt its peak altitude, more than 50 miles, or 264,000 feet, above Earth, passengers will be able to experience three to four minutes of weightlessness and take in sweeping views of the planet, Galactic says. From takeoff to landing, the trips will last about 1.5 hours.\n\nMark \"Forger\" Stucky, who has piloted SpaceShipTwo on more than a dozen test flights, said he takes it \"very seriously\" \u2014 \"but I don't feel like I'm walking the plank or, you know, flipping the coin on whether I'm going to live or not,\" he said.\n\n\"You just have to do the proper quality assurance, in our case training and whatever simulations, to show that you're safe enough,\" he said.\n\nBillionaire's space race\n\nBranson founded Galactic in 2004, around the same time Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk , two other deep-pocketed entrepreneurs, established space companies of their own.\n\nMore than a decade later, the commercial space industry is booming.\n\nMusk, whose ultimate goal is to establish a human colony on Mars, is leading the charge with SpaceX. It has put more than 60 missions into orbit, without crews on board. Musk also plans to launch a trip around the moon in SpaceX's first tourism mission as soon as 2023.\n\nAnd both companies want to adapt their spaceflight technology to shuttle people around the Earth. SpaceX said last year that its forthcoming rocket technology could fly passengers from New York to Shanghai in half an hour\n\nBranson has long envisioned using Galactic's technology for faster point-to-point travel on Earth.\n\n\"Obviously SpaceShipTwo is not a platform that will allow us to go from New York to London in 30 minutes,\" Enrico Palermo, president of The Spaceship Company, Virgin Galactic's manufacturing partner, told CNN Business. \"But it's on the stepping stone.\"\n\nIn the nearer term, Virgin Galactic will go head-to-head with Blue Origin in offering suborbital tourism flights.\n\nBezos' startup is well underway in tests of a capsule and rocket that takes off and lands vertically. The company told CNN Business it has not settled on a ticket price, but Reuters reported they will cost about as much as Virgin Galactic's \u2014 between $200,000 and $300,000 each.\n\nBlue Origin has not yet set a date for its first commercial flight.\n\nRisky business\n\nAerospace companies face daunting risks. The history of human spaceflight is one of triumphs and tragedies. The deadliest were the Space Shuttle disasters of 1986 and 2003, which each claimed lives of all seven astronauts on board.\n\n\"We think a lot about risk in this company, and we know that we will not have a business if we do not have a product that we feel confident flying on ourselves,\" Whitesides said.\n\nThe chief executive has skin in the game \u2014 he's purchased tickets for himself and his wife.\n\nBut, he added, \"If we don't take any risks, we're not going to advance.\"\n\nWhiteside said he hopes space tourism will set off a contagion of the \"overview effect\" \u2014 a phenomenon that astronauts have described as a profound shift in one's worldview after seeing the Earth from afar.\n\n\"You look at climate change, or you look at certain peace and security issues, these are issues that cannot be handled just by one country or one city,\" he said. \"They're issues that have to be handled at a really a global scale.\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story misstated the title of Enrico Palermo.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/tech/virgin-galactic-orbital-space-tourism-virgin-orbit/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Obama at No. 1: 'Becoming' surpasses 'Fire and Fury' in book sales", "text": "(CNN) Michelle Obama's memoir \"Becoming\" has become the best selling book of the year in the United States, surpassing Michael Wolff's \"Fire and Fury\" and others.\n\nWolff's \"Fire\" was a publishing world sensation when it came out in January.

As a reality TV star in a past life, he knows that the end isn't in sight quite yet. As Fox's top legal analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano, said on the air Thursday morning, Cohen's admission is just the \"tip of an iceberg.\" And \"where is the rest of that iceberg? In Bob Mueller's office.\"\n\nNapolitano provided clear-eyed commentary on Fox's newscasts. But the network's pro-Trump talk shows downplayed the seriousness of Thursday's news.

I can't imagine the pressure he's under. I'm not going to pile on. He's got a lot of hard things that he's facing. But this is important.

But now it's gaining traction among an unlikely audience: car makers.\n\nToyota is one of a growing number of auto makers hoping augmented-reality headsets can improve everything from designing cars to manufacturing and fixing them. These headsets let users merge 3-D images with the real world.\n\nFor example, Ford and heavy-duty truck maker Paccar are among those using the HoloLens to help design cars, and Daimler recently said it purchased over 100 HoloLens headsets to train its mechanics with 3-D models of vehicles and parts like brake systems.\n\nBut the augmented-reality market is still small: Eric Abbruzzese, an augmented- and virtual-reality analyst with ABI Research, expects more than 2 million headsets and smart glasses will ship this year. Most of that market is made up of businesses still testing the technology. Abbruzzese predicts it will grow to 29 million by 2023.\n\nThe most recent example of car makers adopting the technology is Toyota. At its headquarters in Japan's Aichi prefecture, employees like Koichi Kayano are experimenting with HoloLens for a variety of tasks. Kayano, a project manager who finds ways to use 3-D models across the company, is using the headset to speed up the process of measuring the thickness of a vehicle's paint and rust-prevention coatings to ensure consistent color and avoid corrosion.\n\nRead More\n\nTypically, this process takes two people an entire day, but the HoloLens cuts it down to four hours -- and only requires one person to do it. Workers traditionally carefully place specially-made paper patterns, which have about 500 holes cut throughout, on the exterior of a car. An employee then scans the visible paint with a measuring instrument. Now, Kayano and his team developed an app that lets them skip the paper pattern and use the HoloLens to project a digital array of dots onto a real car, revealing which areas need to be tested. \"It's as quick as wearing a HoloLens and seeing the measurement points virtually on the vehicle,\" Kayano told CNN Business through an interpreter during a phone interview. \"Preparation time is, like, instant.\" Toyota is also using the headset to visualize new machines on the factory floor, at scale and in 3-D, and determine where they will fit. It's also conducting a similar experiment to figure out whether large vehicles can fit inside a building. But HoloLens still faces adoption challenges. To start, HoloLens is a pricey investment -- it costs $3,000 or $5,000 per headset, depending on whether you want a developer or enterprise version. The hardware also hasn't been updated since it was released two and a half years ago, and at 1.3 pounds, it remains heavy, especially when worn for hours at a time. Meanwhile, the battery only lasts between two and three hours of continuous use. HoloLens has become the \"gold standard\" of high-end AR products due to features like showing the user 3-D images that can stick to one spot in the real world and letting a remote person see what's in the user's real-world field of view, said Abbruzzese. HoloLens is far from the only wearable AR device on the market. It competes with Magic Leap's recently released Magic Leap One headset and AR glasses from companies such as ODG Vuzix and Epson . Still,HoloLens has become the \"gold standard\" of high-end ARproducts due to features like showing the user 3-D images that can stick to one spot in the real world and letting a remote person see what's in the user'sreal-world field of view, said Abbruzzese. However, companies have been somewhat slow to buy and use AR technology due to concerns about cost as well as if it's worth it to provide the resources to train workers. But Abbruzzese said Toyota's use of the HoloLens to measure paint thickness is a clear example of possible savings. \"Toyota can then make a very informed decision about how well this can scale, and [determine] the return on investment,\" he said.

But persuading a sizable chunk of those people to sign up for a separate food website was no small feat.\n\nNYT Cooking charges $5 a month for access to its coverage. That's a relatively big ask in an age when just about every form of entertainment has a monthly fee attached to it, and when amateur cooks already have access to countless recipes on the internet for free.\n\nNotably, the Cooking section is not included in a basic, $15-a-month digital subscription to the Times. Cooking enthusiasts either have to pay the extra $5 for access, or subscribe to a pricier Times bundle.\n\nThat meant the Cooking staff had to come up with a product that was worth the cost of entry. According to editor Sam Sifton, the strategy for the section's current iteration was years in the making.\n\n\"The idea was based in history, really,\" Sifton told CNN Business. He traced it back to the 1960s, when food editor Craig Claiborne amassed a bunch of Times recipes and assembled them into his own cookbook. The book was a bestseller \u2014 for Claiborne, at least. The book belonged to him, and the newspaper didn't profit.\n\n\"We had this notion that we could build a digital version of what was 'The New York Times Cook Book,'\" Sifton added, referencing the title of Claiborne's book. \"But this time, we'd own it.\"\n\nSo Sifton and his team got to work and curated decades of Times recipes they deemed suitable for a modern cooking app. There were a few duds they passed over \u2014 the '70s microwave recipes aren't at the top of Sifton's list \u2014 but many others were classics that deserved another look.\n\n\"Each one of these things we are interrogating and retesting and trying to figure out, so that we're not beholden to whatever the food trend was then,\" Sifton said.\n\nFor example, the Cooking staff dusted off a recipe for an original plum torte creation from Times food columnist Marian Burros that the newspaper published every September from 1983 until 1989. The torte was re-baked and photographed for inclusion on the app. Sifton said recipes like those were chosen because they had become indelible in the minds of Times readers.\n\nNYT Cooking app\n\nWhen the Cooking app launched in September 2014, it featured 16,000 recipes available at no charge. There were plenty of other flourishes to encourage reuse, such as the ability to save recipes or search for meals by keyword.\n\nAll of those features, along with a regular newsletter, helped Cooking develop a user base for when the company began charging for the service three years later. In addition to the 120,000 paid subscriptions, the Times says about three million people now subscribe to its main Cooking newsletter, which doesn't require a subscription. It has also grown its recipe library to about 19,000.\n\nThe team has been tinkering with other ways to promote the brand. It launched another newsletter in September focused on providing readers with a series of weeknight dishes to cook. That newsletter now has 86,000 subscribers.\n\nSifton says he's still expanding his team. He just hired two new editors to assign and edit recipes, work on special projects and focus on social media. He also snagged cook and author Alison Roman as a columnist in the summer. Roman was a Times contributor whose chocolate shortbread cookie recipe went viral earlier this year.\n\nAnd then there's video. This year, Cooking brought on two people to beef up its video presence, both of whom used to work at Tasty, the division of BuzzFeed made popular by its Facebook cooking videos.\n\nSifton said those hires shouldn't be read as an effort to replicate what Tasty has done. He said his team is instead focused on figuring out how to use video to expand the audience for Cooking's archive of quality recipes.\n\n\"I don't think you're going to see top-down videos of cheese-stuffed, deep-fried chicken Oreos,\" Sifton added. \"That's not the direction.\"\n\nHe cited Cooking's recent Thanksgiving coverage as an example of its ambitions, including the smorgasbord of recipes it published earlier this month. The photos of the apple ombre and striped berry pies looked tantalizing enough in print. But online, readers were steered to videos that showed them exactly how to pipe the topping onto the sweet potato meringue, or create a lattice crust for the cranberry herringbone.\n\nAnother digital package featured videos of Times food columnist Melissa Clark recreating an entire Thanksgiving meal with her family.\n\nApple ombre pie from The New York Times Thanksgiving spread.\n\nThere are more plans on the horizon. Sifton said Cooking is going to build its own test kitchen, something the company hasn't had for decades.\n\nAnd when asked if the team would ever consider their own cooking show, NYT Cooking Vice President Amanda Rottier didn't rule it out.\n\n\"We're trying to establish Cooking as a standalone brand to increase our subscription business. I can imagine that extending in a lot of different ways,\" she told CNN Business. \"I think shows is an interesting place that we would love to explore or experiment with down the line.\"\n\nThe Times declined to disclose how much it spends to market Cooking. But Rottier said the team has been building a marketing operation. She added that Cooking promotes the brand through social media, its newsletters, internet search results and by leveraging its relationship with the rest of the Times.\n\nWhatever Cooking does to build awareness of its brand, it's all in the service of convincing more people to pay for the product. Sifton said the rise of subscription models of all types are actually good for Cooking, since that conditions people to pay for content.\n\nAnd then there's the newspaper's ultimate value proposition: It's the Times. It should be worth the money because the company has spent several decades building enough of a reputation to justify it.\n\n\"Look, you're really competing for people's time,\" Rottier said. \"If you're someone who loves to cook and you want to spend money on that, then Cooking is the place to do that.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/21/media/nyt-cooking/index.html", "published": "2018-11-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why Dolce & Gabbana's China blunder could be such a disaster", "text": "New York (CNN Business) Dolce & Gabbana needs to clean up the mess it made in China, or get left out of the country's luxury boom.\n\nOver the past several days, the Italian fashion line has been trying to manage a crisis caused by an ad campaign that critics called \" disrespectful and racist .\" It's also reeling from offensive comments allegedly sent from co-founder Stefano Gabbana's personal Instagram account. The Italian designer has denied writing the messages.\n\nFallout from the controversy has been swift and harsh. Celebrities called for a boycott. Chinese e-commerce sites pulled D&G products from their virtual shelves . The brand canceled a major fashion show in Shanghai that the ads, which featured an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks, were designed to promote.\n\n\"This is a big brand crisis,\" said Tulin Erdem, a professor of marketing at NYU's Stern business school. \"Sometimes brands do recover ... but on a scale of 1-10, [this is] really high up.\"\n\nAlienating customers is always bad for business. But for luxury brands, pushing away Chinese shoppers is a disaster.\n\nA taste for luxury\n\nKering ( KER ), the owner of Gucci and Alexander McQueen, said that sales in China soared 30% in the first half of 2018. French fashion house Hermes credited sales in the country for record profits over the same period. D&G is a private company that does not share its sales figures with the public.\n\nOverall, Chinese consumers spend over $7 billion each year on luxury goods, according to the consultancy McKinsey. That's nearly one-third of the global market.\n\nDolce & Gabbana may have seen the Shanghai show as a way to win over those consumers.\n\nThe company had promoted the canceled event with the hashtags #DGLovesChina and #DGTheGreatShow on its social media accounts.\n\nAs criticism poured in, co-founders Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana tried to explain their thinking.\n\n\"Our dream was to bring to Shanghai a tribute event dedicated to China which tells our history and vision,\" the founders said in a statement posted to Instagram and Twitter on Wednesday. \"It was not simply a fashion show, but something that we created especially with love and passion for China.\"\n\nThe company also said that Gabbana's account was hacked, and that the offensive messages were unauthorized. \"I love China and the Chinese Culture,\" Gabbana wrote on his personal account. \"I'm so sorry for what happened.\"\n\nThe company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nMissing the mark\n\nSome didn't find the apologies sincere.\n\nChinese-French model Estelle Chen, who withdrew from the show, wrote \"you don't love China, you love money,\" in an Instagram post tagging both the brand and Gabbana directly.\n\nChinese consumers are particularly sensitive to criticism that goes viral online, said Thomai Serdari, a strategist in luxury marketing and branding who teaches at NYU's Stern business school.\n\n\"People are really influenced by what's happening online,\" she said. \"They do shop primarily online, and they're excellent researchers,\" she said. They \"have experience in the luxury market and they really know what they're buying.\"\n\nAnd the way young, wealthy Chinese consumers are thinking about luxury is evolving, said Sun Baohong, a marketing professor at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business.\n\n\"Before it was more for showing off social status,\" she said. Now, it's about \"making a personal statement.\"\n\nEven if Dolce & Gabbana hadn't offended people with its ads, she added, it probably would have missed the mark with the campaign.\n\n\"The ad is really showing a very old-fashioned\" image of China, she said. \"Chinese consumers still love foreign brands, but things are changing.\"\n\nMaking amends\n\nNow, D&G has to figure out how to win back Chinese consumers.\n\n\"It's not going to happen overnight,\" said Andrew Gilman, founder of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group.

[and] get back in their good graces,\" he said.\n\nThe company must also share a consistent message across its social media platforms and any other channels it uses to communicate with customers, he said.\n\nMoving forward, it will have to do a better job of understanding Chinese culture. \"You can be a global brand,\" Gilman said, \"but you have to have local sensitivities.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/24/business/dolce-gabbana-china/index.html", "published": "2018-11-24T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn shows problem with Japan corporate culture", "text": "Parissa Haghirian is professor of Japanese management at Sophia University in Tokyo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.\n\nAfter his arrest, Nissan removed Carlos Ghosn as chairman due to his suspected acts of financial misconduct: understating his income and misusing the company's assets. But the Nissan scandal is just the latest in a long line of mishaps to rock the Japanese corporate world. Other manufacturers, such as Kobe Steel, Takeda and Toray Industries, have shocked the public in recent years, admitting to violating safety rules or falsifying data.\n\nBut the scandals are not only a shock to Japanese consumers \u2014 they leave a mark on Japan`s reputation as a reliable and quality-oriented manufacturer and business partner. Japanese corporate structures offer some explanations for the events.\n\nNo specialists\n\nIn most Western companies, employees are hired with a detailed work contract, and only do what's agreed on in the contract. In Japan, employees are hired with no job description, and can be assigned any task.\n\nSince there is no work division in most Japanese companies, all employees can be transferred within a day to a new department, or even location. Companies usually have employees change departments every two years. This job rotation allows company members to know the basic job functions in every part of the firm, so by the time they become top managers, they truly know the company inside-out.\n\nRead More\n\nHowever, this often means that many Japanese firms lack specialists since most managers had a short time to learn about particular business processes. And they're often not up to date when it comes to emerging business topics, such as compliance, diversity management or digitization. Lifetime employment Japanese companies provide lifetime employment, and they expect employees to stay with them until retirement. In fact, many Japanese are hired by their companies right after graduation and stay in their companies for their entire work lives. But a lifetime in the same company with the same colleagues makes it difficult to raise concerns and question existing processes. Even on company boards, we find mainly Japanese managers know only one company and have spent decades working there. Often, new international standards are recognized very late or not at all. What's more, new hires are trained in each department by older members, or sempai, who are role models and informal leaders at the same time. This creates a strong bond between employees, but having such close-knit units and strict hierarchies makes it difficult for new ideas to flourish. Labor laws Japanese labor law makes it difficult to fire full-time employees. They can stay in the same company until retirement and enjoy full protection by the law as long as they dedicate themselves fully to the firm and rotate throughout the company for the first 10 years of their career. Many Japanese employees do not question internal processes because they cannot compare to processes in former work places or other companies. The one-company-per-lifetime system creates a strong bond between employee and firm and makes it difficult for employees to question or criticize internal processes, even if they perceive them as wrong or unethical. What's next? Now that trust in Japanese companies has been deeply shaken, it's obvious that Japan needs to beef up corporate governance regulations. The government has already taken some first steps. As of 2015, Japanese boards are supposed to have two external directors. Though the code itself isn't legally binding, companies have to declare why they're not following it, which puts pressure on them to do so. The government hopes diversifying traditional boards will lead to more innovative decision-making amongst board members. Changes in Japanese society will also have an effect on Japanese companies. Japan is currently facing a very serious labor shortage because of a population decline. The unemployment rate is at a record low of 2.3%, and companies regard recruiting as their biggest future challenge. JUST WATCHED The rise and fall of Carlos Ghosn Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The rise and fall of Carlos Ghosn 02:36 The Japanese government has reacted to this population decline by relaxing immigration laws and making it easier for international managers to enter Japanese firms. These international employees may bring more international perspectives, as well as implement new procedures in traditional Japanese firms to make them more competitive on a global scale. In the coming years, they may also influence attitude toward compliance and safety standards. Furthermore, whistleblowing has become more common in Japan in recent years. Many of the scandals in recent months have resulted in security risks for the Japanese population, so more employees have begun reporting them to authorities. The Nissan scandal is a wake-up call for Japanese companies to rethink their processes and install effective compliance management processes.

The car's 25-year-old engine made its distinctive soft rumble behind us as he accelerated out toward the next turn. For a few moments, we stopped talking. I was enjoying the drive, but also the pleasant irony of it.\n\nThat's because Krafcik is the CEO of Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google's parent company, Alphabet.\n\nI first got to know Krafcik years ago when he was the head of Hyundai Motor America. Before that, he had worked at Ford. He owns a small collection of cars that includes two Porsches (neither particularly high-end), a souped up Volvo wagon and a little known bare-bones British sports car called a Caterham.\n\nThese aren't cars for showing off. These are cars for driving. Because John Krafcik loves to drive.\n\nHe makes no secret about it and he sees no conflict. This is not like the owner of a vegan restaurant grilling bison burgers on his back deck.\n\n\"You ask a room full of people: 'Do you love to drive?' and most people actually would raise their hand,\" he said while he drove. \"But if we ask the question a slightly different way, 'Do you love commuting? Do you love driving on your commute?' I think most people would say. 'Eh, not so much.'\"\n\nThat's the problem Waymo is trying solve, he said. The company doesn't want to do away with driving altogether, just the driving that's unpleasant and boring, he explained. Starting soon, Waymo will be making its driverless van rides available to the public in Arizona. From there, the roll out of the service will happen gradually.\n\nIt's going to be a long, long time before someone takes my hands off the steering wheel of a car.\" John Krafcik\n\n\"It's going to be a long, long time before someone takes my hands off the steering wheel of a car,\" he said. \"That's just not something that's going to happen in the short term.\"\n\nIt's not only that he, personally, doesn't want to give up driving. He actually doesn't even think it's possible for Waymo or any company to entirely replace human drivers in all conceivable scenarios \u2014 at least, not in the foreseeable future.\n\nHuman drivers aren't that hard to improve upon, as Krafcik pointed out.\n\n\"I've got these two eyes. That's all I've got, these two optical sensors, and it's amazing that we can drive so well just with these simple optical sensors and they're augmented a little bit with these three pieces of glass otherwise known as mirrors, and this is my full complement of sensing technology,\" he said.\n\nOn top of that, a human driver's optical sensors are attached to only one brain. Each human must learn to drive on his or her own.\n\nA Waymo driverless van has video cameras, laser and radar that can see and sense things in all directions around the vehicle continuously. And the cars learn from the experience of every other Waymo car, creating, as Krafcik puts it, \"the world's most experienced driver.\" Each day, the Waymo driver adds another 25,000 miles to its pool of experience, more than the average person covers in two years.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the technology is perfect.\n\nTaking a joy ride with Krafcik, Waymo's CEO.\n\nKrafcik parked his 1993 Porsche at Alice's Restaurant, about 30 minutes from Waymo's headquarters. I had suggested someplace closer, knowing he's a busy executive and probably pressed for time. But, like I said, he likes to drive.\n\nWe sat outside with a couple of sodas and a box of fries and talked about what automated cars, even with all those sensors and all that experience, won't be able to do. Engineers talk about L5, or Level 5 autonomous driving. That's as autonomous as any vehicle could possibly be. At L5, you could get into a car at any time under any weather conditions and say \"Take me....\" anywhere. But L5 is impossible, said Krafcik.\n\n\"That's a somewhat unreasonable expectation,\" he said, \"and it's sort of not even necessary because we so rarely drive from San Francisco to Santiago, Chile. We just don't do that.\"\n\nThe highest level of automation you can buy now is Level 3, at best. That means the car can drive itself in certain conditions, such as on a multi-lane highway, but with a human driver always paying attention and ready to take over.\n\nWaymo cars will operate in designated areas on familiar roads. Those designated areas will widen over time covering more places. But Krafcik doesn't foresee a day when the need for human drivers will be entirely obviated. But that need will diminish.\n\nEven then, though, no one will take the steering wheel from Krafcik's hands. Not even his own company's creations.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/21/success/waymo-ceo-driverless-cars/index.html", "published": "2018-11-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "He left the slums of Iran as a teen.

In just five years, the dolls turned into a billion-dollar global phenomenon with fans dubbing the edgy, multi-ethnic Bratz as the \"anti-Barbie.\" At its peak, Bratz accounted for as much as 75% of MGA's total sales, says Larian.\n\nBratz dolls on display in Larian's LA office.\n\nBut Bratz's success was stymied by a legal battle with Mattel over who owned the brand.

He came up with the concept for his next startup after paying $5 for a bottle of Evian at the airport.\n\nRead More\n\nBy making it easy and inexpensive to find water nearby, Tap hopes people will cut down on plastic waste and change their behavior. Tap signage will help steer customers into retail stores for water refills. Consumers may also start seeing blue \"Tap\" signs in store windows signaling the business is friendly to thirsty guests. The app provides profiles on each location and what it offers, such as flavored or sparkling water, and whether it comes free or at cost from a water cooler, counter service or a drinking fountain. Earlier this month, the UN Intergovernmental Panel released a bombshell climate change report that warned global warming is on track to have a disastrous impact if nothing changes by 2030. The report said the impact could result in extreme drought, wildfires, floods and food shortages for hundreds of millions of people. Plastic waste is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which causes the Earth's surface temperature to rise. Eight million tons of plastic enter the water each year, according to the World Economic Forum, and more plastic is expected in our oceans than fish by 2050 in terms of weight, if our current usage of plastic continues. But Tap isn't the first to connect people to clean drinking water. Nonprofit WeTap, an app that has been around for about six years, helps people find to the closest public drinking fountains. If Tap gets off the ground, its unclear if stores will be bombarded by people looking for refills and how retailers might react.

Democratic Republic of Congo's President Joseph Kabila Kabila has ruled since his father's assassination in 2001. He nominated his Interior Minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary as his successor.

Health workers operate within an Ebola safety zone in the Health Center in Iyonda, near Mbandaka, DRC in June.

More than 350 cases have been confirmed in North Kivu province, where the epicenter is, and neighboring Ituri province. Fighting between militant groups and government forces has made it difficult for health workers to access some of the hardest-hit areas. Earlier this month an armed group attacked UN peacekeepers in the city of Beni, in North Kivu province. Earlier in the week, at least seven peacekeepers were killed and 10 others were wounded in clashes with militias.

South Sudanese human rights lawyer Phillips Ngong told CNN the assets were proposed in the context of an auction that took place in person, and the dowry amount pledged was higher than usual, which prompted a discussion on Facebook.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Kok Alat did not discuss the dowry size and said media commentary about the terms of the marriage being decided through an \"auction\" was \"fake.\"\n\n\"I'm personally disappointed, and many people who know how our tradition works are most disappointed,\" he said. \"There is no human that can auction another human. South Sudan is a country with a high level of human rights.\"\n\nRead More\n\nKok Alat says what took place was part of the culture of the Dinka people, the largest ethnic group in South Sudan \"This is just a marriage like any other marriage. I don't know why it has become more special than the other traditional marriages, which are done before and which are going to be done again,\" he said. Concern over social media The practice of dowry negotiations is traditional in Dinka culture and in much of East Africa and beyond. According to children's rights organization Plan International, the bride was \"married off to the winning bidder\" at a November 3 ceremony in the country's Eastern Lake Section. Five men, some of whom were reportedly high-ranking South Sudanese government officials, participated in the \"auction,\" Plan International said. Plan International said it originally became aware of the marriage via the Voice of America but subsequently confirmed the details through its local staff. Activists said they are concerned this practice could inspire other families to use social media sites to receive larger payments. \"In South Sudan, Facebook and social media is a brand new thing. Someone just took a picture. And it just went viral,\" human rights lawyer Ngong said. The wedding occurred November 3, according to Suzy Natana of the South Sudanese National Alliance for Women Lawyers, citing locals the association spoke with. Facebook came under fire for posts that discussed the price being offered for the bride by the highest bidder, as well as how much Facebook users would offer for her. Though Facebook said one post was taken down on November 9, posts discussing the dowry were still live on Friday, November 23. Facebook said in a statement to CNN that any form of \"human trafficking -- whether posts, pages, ads or groups is not allowed on Facebook.\" \"We removed the post and permanently disabled the account belonging to the person who posted this to Facebook,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement. The man who won the bidding for the teenager, businessman Kok Alat, did not find out about the girl through Facebook, Ngong said. But the marriage of the girl is still egregious, Ngong said, particularly as a state government official is believed to be among the bidders. Ngong said it was a direct violation of child marriage laws by those in power: \"Anything that happens that is not in the best interest of the child is a violation. And the constitution and child laws are very clear on that.\" South Sudan's Constitution states that marriage requires the \"free and full consent\" of those intending to marry. A child is defined as anyone under the age of 18, according to the country's Child Act, 2008, which adds that \"every child has the right to be protected from early marriage.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/24/africa/south-sudanese-man-responds-to-backlash-to-his-marriage/index.html", "published": "2018-11-24T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Oby Ezekwesili: Bring Back our Girls activist vows to disrupt 'Nigeria's politics of failure'", "text": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Bring Back our Girls activist and former Nigerian minister Oby Ezekwesili has thrown her hat into the election ring for Nigeria's upcoming 2019 elections and says her candidacy will \"disrupt the politics of failure\" in Africa's most populous nation.\n\nEzekwesili in an interview with Christiane Amanpour said bad governance had become endemic in Nigeria and citizens no longer hold leaders accountable for corruption or corrupt acts.\n\n\"It [Nigerian politics] produced dismal results such that today Nigeria is the world's capital of extreme poverty,\" she said.\n\n\"It's totally unacceptable.

For now, I can't tell you any more.\"\n\nThe man gave another number for CNN to call him on later, but those calls went unanswered.\n\nLibya's Department for Combatting Illegal Migration (DCIM) did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nLast week, a small group on the Nivin agreed to leave, including a mother and infant child.\n\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) said there were 28 minors on board the ship, and that there were 77 people in total.\n\n\"For sure there are children on board, and as far as we know the authorities are trying to find a solution for the current situation,\" said Unicef Libya spokesperson Mostafa Omar, speaking on Monday.\n\nDar told CNN, some of the officials, who visited the Nivin Monday afternoon threatened to put them in prison in Malta if they refused to leave the ship.\n\nIn a statement released last week, human rights organization Amnesty International said Libyan, European and Panamanian authorities should ensure that those on board weren't forcibly taken to a Libyan detention center \"where they could face torture and other abuse.\"\n\n\"It is high time the Libyan authorities put an end to the ruthless policy of unlawfully detaining refugees and migrants. No one should be sent back to Libya to be held in inhumane conditions and face torture and other ill-treatment,\" said Heba Morayef, Amnesty's Middle East and North Africa Director.\n\nDar told CNN that several people on board were already injured, after being burnt by oil from the rubber boat, they had initially traveled in.\n\nHe said they were forced to urinate in bottles, because there was no bathroom on the Nivin, though they were grateful international organizations had been delivering food and water to the ship.\n\n\"We're so tired, so tired,\" Dar said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/africa/libyan-migrants-forced-off-ship-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-20T00:00:00"}, {"title": "'Rambo' CAR militia leader charged with war crimes", "text": "(CNN) A Central African Republic (CAR) militia leader widely known as \"Rambo\" has been charged with a number of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, torture and the use of child soldiers, at the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\n\nAlfred Yekatom is the former commander of a group of 3,000 members of the anti-balaka movement, a group consisting mainly of Christians that opposed a largely Muslim rebel alliance known as Seleka, the ICC said.\n\nHis crimes allegedly took place \"in various locations within the Central African Republic, including the capital Bangui and Lobaye prefecture,\" the court said.\n\nThe anti-balaka coalition, which translates to \"anti-machete,\" was formed after Seleka ousted President Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 and replaced him with the country's first Muslim President.\n\nThe coalition has repeatedly clashed with Seleka groups and led frequent massacres against Muslim populations in the country over the course of its ruinous civil war, according to Amnesty International\n\nRead More\n\nAppearing in court to be informed of the charges leveled against him, Yekatom -- who is also a member of Parliament -- claimed that upon his arrest he was held in presidential detention for a month and was tortured and beaten with the butts of Kalashnikov rifles.

In the 1980's, Robert would sneak out to the newly opened cinema halls to watch movies, coming back later to reenact every action-packed moment.\n\nIsaac says looking back, \"Why I wanted to start action movies is because when I was growing up, all film stars I knew were all action stars... I knew of Rambo, Schwarzenegger, Jet Li, there's Bruce Lee, Wang Yu. My favorite is Chuck Norris.\"\n\nThis love for action and nostalgia for its early stars features heavily in Isaac's films, one of his most successful is titled \"Bruce U\", about a Ugandan man who perfects the art of kung fu.\n\nPhotos: Behind the scenes at Wakaliwood Self-taught director Isaac Nabwaana directing children and adults in a cannibal movie.

Hide Caption 10 of 10\n\nThough Isaac had decided very early on that he wanted to make movies, his family was not convinced. His grandmother who raised him, his sisters and brothers expressed doubt that it was possible.\n\nIsaac remembers telling his brother Robert of his dreams. \"I told him that one day I'll make a movie, he said, \"No, you cannot make it. Because movies, you made [need] millions of dollars to make movies.\"\n\nYet defying all odds, Isaac has made over forty movies, with three more in the works. Robert, his brother, plays multiple roles in every Ramon production, as well as Isaac's wife, Harriet, and his children.\n\nThe Wakaliwood community has grown from Isaac's immediate family to a large and diverse group.\n\nPeople come from all over the country, and the world to see what Isaac has created and to take part in projects. One fan came all the way from New York City and never left Wakaliwood.\n\nNew York film buff Alan Hofmanis appeared on Isaac's doorstep six years ago after seeing a YouTube trailer for \"Who Killed Captain Alex?\", Isaac's first successful action film which was made for under $200.\n\nSometimes Wakaliwood actors get into character to gain some extra attention while selling the films.\n\nAlan recalled watching the trailer with some friends in a crowded East Village bar and having a distinctly different response from those around him. He remembers, \"everyone's laughing and I wasn't laughing. Like yea it's funny, yea I think it's great, but who are these people? To me it just looked like genius.\"\n\nThat instinct led Alan straight to Wakaliwood, and he's never looked back. \"I saw the thing, I bought the ticket, I went there, and I said hello, my name is Alan, I'm a fan from New York City and I'm here to talk, and that was it and we spoke for about six hours,\" he says, \"And that's how it started.\"\n\nToday, Alan lives in a room attached to Isaac's house in Wakaliga. He is an integral part of the team. He wears many hats as co-producer, distributor, and even an actor. Alan plays three characters in Isaac's upcoming movie \"Eaten Alive,\" a zombie thriller that is one of several movies that Isaac is at work on.\n\nDirector Isaac Nabwaana and Alan Hofmanis\n\nIn it, Alan, thinner with longer hair, has a likeness to Chuck Norris. In these scenes, Alan is hunted and eaten by cannibals because Isaac has decided, \"Chuck Norris is probably delicious\".\n\nIn scenes being filmed, Alan portrays Norris' brother who is seeking to avenge Chuck Norris.\n\nIsaac says his ideas spring from the real-life stories and scenes around him. For \"Eaten Alive\", Isaac based the film on a news story about an alleged cannibal killing that took place in a central Uganda region called Rakai.\n\nHis imagination is brought to life by a multi-talented man named Dauda. Dauda transforms Isaac's backyard into a new scene every night.\n\nDauda is the props master, set designer, electrician, mechanic, and sometimes even an actor. He has crafted every single one of the props on their sets, and is solely responsible for translating into reality Isaac's creative vision.\n\nIsaac's wife Harriet is a self-taught makeup artist, having learned a variety of techniques from watching YouTube videos. Harriet uses a multitude of household items to get the effect she desires, including toilet paper, office glue, and latex, if she can find some. Harriet prefers zombie makeup to beauty makeup.\n\n\"Everything is fun doing makeup.\", she says, \"Everybody is fun, because everyday I find new things while doing makeup and it adds on my profession.\"\n\nA hallmark of the Wakaliwood lifestyle is inclusion. Nabwana has made it a goal to welcome everyone from interested fans, the curious, and anyone interested in film, no matter where they're from.\n\n\"One thing we don't do is we don't discriminate against tribe or what. Whoever comes, what tribe, whatever tribe you are from, I give you ... Whatever region, I give you a chance.\n\nBecause for me I believe art is art and it's a God-given thing. The reason why you came to me, maybe it is because God sent you to me and I will lift your talent. It's an effort. For me, I believe, I don't chase anyone.\n\nThat's why you see we have people from Northern Uganda, we have people from Western Uganda, from Eastern Uganda, Central. So we bring together everyone.\"\n\nCondoms are used as props to dispense blood\n\nSome of the most passionate about movie making are the children living in Wakaliwood. These include Isaac's children, both biological and adopted. The children are called \"Waka Stars\" and participate in all activities that the adults are involved in. They are musicians, they do martial arts, and they act in movies.\n\nAccording to Isaac, the children are treated like adults so that they learn to act like adults. He says, \"when we are shooting, they know, they can even control themselves. We don't chase them because we feel like these children one day will be directors, will be actors.\"\n\nThese children are the true mark of Isaac's legacy and will carry on the future of the brand. In Alan's words, \"I don't know what the legacy of this will be, because even if it stops, it can't stop. If he dies, there's a whole back catalog. It's not over. There's all the village and the kids.\"\n\nAs for Isaac, he believes the youth are essential to confirming a future for everything he has built. \"If we now try to involve the youth they will grow up... knowing that Uganda can make movies,\" he says, \"and then the industry will stay. So the youth are very vital in this.\"\n\nBut whatever lies ahead, it is certain that Isaac has taken his boyhood fantasies of making action movies and made them a reality.\n\nThat reality is Wakaliwood.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/31/africa/uganda-wakaliwood-films-kampala-wakaliga/index.html", "published": "2018-10-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Bobi Wine: The 'Ghetto President' versus the strongman President", "text": "(CNN) In one corner is Bobi Wine, the charismatic and wildly popular musician, affectionately known in Uganda as 'the Ghetto President.'\n\nIn the other is the real President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, who -- like many of Africa's former revolutionaries -- has clung to power for decades, amid growing calls for him to step down.\n\nMuseveni, 73, has ruled the east African nation with an iron fist since he took power in 1986 and is not known to be soft on his opponents; he has seen off many of them in his 32-year rule.\n\nBut some commentators are saying that Wine -- with his musical and political clout as well as a solid youth base -- is the real challenger to Museveni's throne.\n\n\"Bobi Wine poses a real threat to Museveni, more so in consideration that young Ugandans, many of whom are unemployed, constitute a huge percentage of the active electorate,\" says Jimmy Spire Ssentongo, an Associate Dean at Uganda Martyrs University.\n\n\"Given the widespread public desperation in Uganda, all many people want is a person who shows the potential of removing Museveni. All else is secondary,\" he said in an interview with The Conversation\n\nBefore he was Bobi Wine, the musician was known as Robert Kyagulanyi. He grew up in the slums of Uganda, raised by a single mother, but turned to music as a way out of grinding poverty.\n\nHis upbeat dancehall music style and catchy lyrics dominated airwaves and clubs across East Africa from the early 2000s.\n\nSinging frequently in his native Luganda, the songs contained strong messages, often railing against social injustice in the country.\n\nHe called on the citizenry to \"rise up and raise their voices\" to challenge oppression.\n\n\"Don't shy away from working for Uganda, because it is your own country, even if your boss was not your choice. Just play your part, because this is your country,\" he sang in one of his hits, \" Situka.\n\nWith such politically conscious lyrics, a career in politics was, perhaps, inevitable.\n\nIn 2017, he stood for Parliament as an independent, campaigning on the catchphrase : \"Since Parliament has failed to come to the ghetto, then we shall bring the ghetto to Parliament.\"\n\nHe was elected by a landslide and has since proved to be a thorn in Museveni's side, pitching his tent with opposition legislators and continuing to make music, mostly critical of the President's long-term rule.\n\nHis popularity has not gone unnoticed by the government.\n\nSome of his songs, including \"Freedom,\" have been banned in the country.\n\n\"See our leaders become misleaders,\" Wine sang. \"And see our mentors become tormentors. Freedom fighters become dictators. They look upon the youth and say we're destructors.\"\n\nBobi Wine, 36, was a toddler when Museveni came to power.\n\nA former defense minister, Museveni had formed a political party that would go on to overthrow the brutal Idi Amin dictatorship in 1979.\n\nUganda has one of the youngest populations in the world; more than three-quarters of the country's 35.6 million people are below the age of 30.\n\nAccording to the International Labor Organization , young people form 83% of the unemployed in Uganda.\n\nMany are frustrated and long for opportunities that will lift them out of poverty.\n\nPresident for life?\n\nOnce revered for unseating one of Africa's most brutal leaders, Museveni himself now runs the risk of becoming a dictator.\n\nHe has changed the constitution twice to extend his stay in office. In 2005, legislators removed presidential term limits to allow him to stand for elections.\n\nA bill was also passed last year eliminating constitutional limits on anyone serving as president past the age of 75, paving the way for Museveni to become president for life.\n\nWhen it was debated in Parliament, Wine joined opposition MPs to shut down the law.\n\nHe said in a Facebook post that it was time for Museveni to release his firm grip over the nation.\n\n\"Ugandans made it clear long ago that they are opposed to a life presidency,\" he wrote. \"They don't want the constitution tampered with in any way.\"\n\nArguments during the presidential age limit debate descended into chaos as lawmakers exchanged punches and threw chairs at each other in Parliament.\n\nThe amendment also sparked protests among students and activists.\n\n#FreeBobiWine\n\nWine has used his star power and political office to galvanize Uganda's youth to take action against unpopular policies.\n\nWhen the President introduced a controversial social media tax earlier this year, Wine led a protest march to Uganda's Parliament to demand a review.\n\nHowever, he is not without controversy. In 2014, the pop star was forced to cancel a UK tour after he was denied entry into Britain following protests from gay activists who accused him of promoting homophobic lyrics, according to the UK Guardian\n\nHe later wrote: \"I am personally not out to threaten the life of any individual based on their sexual orientation, I just do not agree with them (homosexuals),\" he said. \"This is my opinion and happens to be that of 99% of Ugandans,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nFollowing his arrest and alleged torture, Wine has gained global prominence and sparked an international protest movement.\n\nThe lawmaker was arrested on August 15 alongside opposition MPs after rioting broke out between rival parties ahead of a local parliamentary election.\n\nWine said on Twitter that his driver was shot dead. Police said Museveni's car was attacked in the aftermath of the violence.\n\nThe public has reacted to the recent events with outrage and anger, most of it channeled through social media.\n\nFrom Tokyo to Washington, activists and fans joined the #FreeBobiWine hashtag online and took to the streets to demand the singer's release.\n\nActivists and civil society groups marched to the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, on August 23 to protest against Wine's detention.\n\nInfluential figures in the music industry, including Chris Martin, Angelique Kidjo, Damon Albarn and others, also joined the campaign.\n\nThousands of Kenyans marched to the country's Parliament and the Ugandan embassy in Nairobi to hand over a petition for the singer's release.\n\n'A brutal regime'\n\nKampala's Mayor, Erias Lukwago, told CNN Wine's arrest has exposed Museveni's \"brutal regime.\"\n\n\"The level of injustice in Uganda is too much; this brutal regime wants to suppress opposing voices. But they must know that Ugandans are angry, and they will no longer tolerate any form of oppression,\" Lukwago, who is also on Wine's legal team, said.\n\nThe singer, now facing treason charges, was taken into military detention following his arrest. He posted a lengthy statement Monday detailing the physical abuse he says he suffered at the hands of the military during and after his arrest last month.\n\nWine, who is seeking treatment in the United States, claims to have been beaten with an iron bar, punched, kicked, hit with pistol butts and had his ears pulled with \"something like pliers.\"\n\n\"After some time, I could almost no longer feel the pain. I could only hear what they were doing from afar. My cries and pleas went unheeded. The things they were speaking to me all this while, I cannot reproduce here. Up to now, I cannot understand how these soldiers who I probably had never met before in person could hate me so much,\" Wine says in the statement.\n\nSafely arrived in the US where I'll be receiving specialised treatment following the brutal torture at the hands of SFC soldiers.

I cannot believe what they're saying unless the medical personnel confirm to us that they were indeed tortured. Until the medical team from the government ascertain or confirms to us that they were tortured that's when I can say they were,\" he said.\n\nMuseveni also took to his blog and social media to dismiss the torture allegations as \"fake news.\"\n\nHe accused Wine and the arrested MPs of intimidating voters.\n\n\"Anybody who is a friend of the young politicians like Bobi Wine should advise them that shortcuts like cheating, importing voters, intimidating the voters of the other side, ballot stuffing... will lead them and Uganda to doom,\" Museveni said.\n\nClinging to power\n\nWhile much of the developed world embraces the energy of youth in leadership positions, it is not often the case in Africa.\n\nFrom Uganda to Cameroon, many of the continent's leaders are aging and clinging to power while their countries struggle to keep pace with global developments.\n\nZimbabwe's Robert Mugabe was forced to relinquish power in 2017 after 37 years of autocratic rule.

Nigerian officials presented plans for the Museum at a BDG meeting in October. A spokesman for the Governor of Edo said that designs are being finalized in collaboration with the Royal Court of Benin.\n\nA spokesman for the British Museum said European museums would play an active role in developing an elite institution suitable for housing exhibits that are considered to be among the greatest ever African artworks.\n\n\"The key agenda item (at the October meeting) was how partners can work together to establish a museum in Benin City with a rotation of Benin works of art from a consortium of European museums,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"The museums in attendance have all agreed to lend artifacts to the Benin Royal Museum on a rotating basis, to provide advice as requested on building and exhibition design, and to cooperate with the Nigerian partners in developing training, funding, and a legal framework for the display in a new planned museum.\"\n\nBenin bronzes on display at the British Museum in London.

The present agreement notes that Nigerian partners have not ceded claims for permanent restitution, and officials remain determined to secure the bronzes on a permanent basis.\n\n\"We are grateful these steps are being taken but we hope they are only the first steps,\" Crusoe Osagie, spokesman for the Governor of Edo, told CNN. \"If you have stolen property, you have to give it back.\"\n\nOsagie called for greater pressure on European governments to return the bronzes.\n\nBreaking the deadlock\n\nNigerian claims received a boost with the release of a new report commissioned by the French government that calls for wholesale restitution of artifacts seized during the colonial era.\n\nThe report from academics Felwine Sarr and Benedicte Savoy, prompted by President Emmanuel Macron's 2017 commitment to return African heritage, recommended that items taken without consent should be liable to restitution claims.\n\nMany of the estimated 90,000 artifacts of sub-Saharan African origin held at French institutions could be contested under the report's criteria.\n\nSarr and Savoy further recommended that key, symbolic pieces long sought by claimant nations should be immediately returned - including several French-held Benin bronzes.\n\nThe report also proposed a series of bilateral agreements between the French government and African states to bypass French laws barring museums from releasing their collections, which have proved a longstanding barrier to restitution. Such agreements would allow for permanent restitution rather than loans.\n\nThe French government has responded to the report by announcing an initial 26 artworks will be returned to the state of Benin, with further restitution to follow.\n\nPressure building\n\nFrance's example will increase the pressure on museums across Europe, which has been building on several fronts.\n\nGrassroots campaign groups within European countries are demanding restitution, such as in Germany, where 40 organizations recently signed an open\n\nletter calling for the return of historical artifacts.\n\nThe letter prompted German institutions to conduct inventories of their collections to determine which items were acquired illicitly.\n\nThere is also growing recognition of the validity of restitution claims from a new generation of political leaders. Leader of the UK Labour party Jeremy Corbyn has said that if elected, his government would be willing to discuss the return of \"anything stolen or taken from occupied or colonial possession.\"\n\nSeveral influential private collectors have also taken the side of African claimants, such as British citizen Mark Walker, who voluntarily returned a set of Benin bronzes captured by his grandfather.\n\nMuseums are also facing a raft of increasingly determined claims from the governments of dispossessed nations across the world, from sub-Saharan Africa to Greece's claims for the Elgin Marbles, to Chile's appeal for Easter Island statues\n\nFew longstanding observers of a saga that has been taking place since the end of the colonial era expect these matters to be resolved quickly. President Macron's initial commitment to return just 26 pieces suggests a long term process.\n\nMuseums and national governments are likely to resist wholesale restitution, and national laws preventing museums from disbursing their collections will continue to present a formidable barrier.\n\nBut if the wheels are turning slowly, they do at least appear to be shifting.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/africa/africa-uk-benin-bronze-return-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "She opened a sex shop for women, then the backlash started", "text": "CNN is committed to covering gender inequality wherever it occurs in the world. This story is part of As Equals , a year-long series.\n\nCotonou, Benin -- \"I am in the business of pleasure,\" 33-year-old Antares Adjibi said, a blue dildo and silicone breasts sitting on a shelf behind her.\n\nAdjibi's sex shop in the heart of Cotonou is an unlikely enterprise in Benin, a west African country steeped in tradition and religion.\n\nNearly half of the population is Christian, almost 28% is Muslim, while more than 11% practice Vodun, or Voodoo, which originated in the region of the French-speaking West African nation and is widely regarded as its birthplace.\n\nThere are a few online businesses in Benin which sell sex accessories, but boutiques specializing in the products are uncommon. In neighboring Nigeria, sex shops are growing in popularity in Lagos, but are rare outside of cities.\n\n\"Sexuality is still taboo in Africa, particularly in Benin,\" Adjibi says. \"Women don't have freedom of expression. They are not free to express their sexuality.\"\n\nAntares Adjibi opened her store in 2013.\n\nAdjibi opened her store Abasik in 2013 with the aim of changing that. The walls of the small shop are lined with brightly colored, flowing lingerie for women. The shelves of a separate room are filled with phallus shaped toys, handcuffs, and flesh-colored molds. But Adjibi wanted to do more than sell lingerie and sex toys, so she enrolled in sexual psychology courses and began holding free workshops for women seeking sexual advice. In the years since, she says she has helped to counsel hundreds of couples.\n\nThe concept of a sex shop was so novel in Benin that when it was launched, Adjibi was invited to speak on a local radio station about the importance of women's sexual pleasure. The backlash was immediate.\n\nCritics targeted her social media accounts, posting comments like: \"What are you talking about? God created sex, so how could anything be wrong?\"\n\nOthers flagged images of her products so frequently as inappropriate that Facebook temporarily suspended her store's page, a problem that persists even though the images match the content of the articles she posts.\n\nMost of Abasik's customers are women.\n\nIn spite of the online opposition, Adjibi's free workshops are still crowded with women and couples. She estimates that 70% of her clients are single women and the majority come to her for issues regarding pleasure.\n\nVeronique Tognifode, a gynecologist and obstetrician from Cotonou, who works with the Association for Education, Sexuality and Health in Africa (APESSA), says that taboo associated with sex, and speaking about sexuality, is slowly changing in Benin.\n\nFour years ago, she began answering students' questions about sex in schools across the country.\n\n\"The goal is to promote responsible sexuality, but it's also a way to generate more communication around sexuality so they are given answers without taboo,\" Tognifode said.\n\nAnd the topic of pleasure is becoming more relevant, according to Tognifode. She says she often fields questions about sexual health and sexually transmitted diseases, but that queries about masturbation and introducing objects during sex are becoming more frequent.\n\n\"Because of social media, young people have access to information. But it's not just knowledge, it's also braving the taboo of asking more questions,\" Tognifode said.\n\nA joint study by medical professionals from Benin, Sierra Leone, and The Democratic Republic of Congo surveyed 500 young people from Cotonou and found that sex solely for procreation is becoming less of a priority for young people. Half of the young men surveyed said that they have sex just for pleasure and half of the young women said that they have sex for love.\n\nAdjibi says that the types of questions Tognifode gets take a bit of coaxing from customers in her store. Women frequently browse lingerie until an employee asks if they want to see the toys because they are too embarrassed to ask for themselves.\n\nAdjibi told a client who said she had a stronger sex drive than her husband that she should express to her partner when she's in the mood.\n\n\"I can't just tell him that I want him. Women don't do that. Women can't just say 'I want you to make love to me.' It's impossible,\" Adjibi said the customer responded.\n\nIt's an attitude that Adjibi tries to address in her workshops.\n\n\"Women have the power to show their partners that their job isn't just to have children. They can be a life partner, a lover, an adviser,\" she says.\n\nWomen have the power to show their partners that their job isn't just to have children. They can be a life partner, a lover, an adviser. Antares Adjibi\n\nIn Benin, sexuality is typically only discussed in relation to sexual health because, despite a growing interest in safe sex, contraceptive use remains relatively low, according to a 2017 study of Benin in The Central African Journal of Public Health. This presents a barrier to how effectively women can plan pregnancies, which has a direct bearing on quality of life.\n\nLissette Coovi, a pharmacy director from Cotonou realized two years ago that a growing number of her customers were asking for products to improve sexual pleasure.\n\nIn response, she suggested that her cousin and his partner move to Benin to start an online sex toy business. The couple moved from France almost two years ago and started a business selling sex toys and accessories, called Smielo.\n\nAntares Adjibi says the focus of her store is women's sexual pleasure.\n\nCustomers can peruse products on their website and pick up purchases in a backroom at one of three pharmacies, all located in Cotonou. Going around back to pick up a sex toy doesn't raise suspicion since many pharmacies already have a backroom where customers can ask private questions of the pharmacist. All of the products come in discreet packaging with only the company's name.\n\n\"Most communication with clients is via text. When clients come to the pharmacy, they're very embarrassed, so they prefer to only interact with one person to maintain as much discretion as possible,\" Coovi said.\n\nBut Antares Adjibi says this discretion only feeds the taboo, which she believes hurts women the most. Though the inquiring shopper can find sex toys and lingerie in shops which also carry a hodgepodge of other products in the country's largest market, Dantokpa, it's Adjibi's insistence of the importance of sexual pleasure for women that makes her stand out.\n\n\"I tell my clients that they can't be afraid. They aren't doing anything wrong by learning about their bodies and sexual pleasure,\" she said. \"Our ancestors did things differently, but if we want to change our lives for the better, we have to take the risk. I won't hide.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/23/africa/benin-sex-store-intl-asequals/index.html", "published": "2018-11-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why this state-run rehab clinic lets addicts shoot up", "text": "Dakar, Senegal (CNN) Inside the grounds of Fann hospital in Senegal, men and women form a substantial queue.\n\nThose without seats loiter in hallways, and others able to bear the sweltering heat outside play checkers under a canopy of overgrown mango trees.\n\nThey are here for the Center for the Integrated Management of Addictions.\n\nTraffickers are creating a market in a region where there was absolutely no market\n\nA nurse calls them one by one dispensing a small cup of blue liquid.

He began snorting heroin after traveling to Paris in his early twenties to study for a degree in technology.\n\nBy the age of 27 he was jailed for dealing cocaine and deported home after serving a three-year sentence.\n\n\"My family put a lot of hopes on me. When I started using they were extremely disappointed. There was a lot of deception,\" he recalls.

Previously there were no official statistics on how many people in the country were injecting drugs. A 2010 study of six states in Nigeria provided the only data for West Africa as a region.\n\nProduce grown in the garden by patients goes to the center's canteen.\n\n'Harm reduction' through free needles\n\nSenegal's government reacted with a \"harm reduction\" program when the survey was released. Back then 18,614 free needles and 17,564 condoms were handed out to addicts over a two-year period.\n\nBy December 2014, the government opened CEPIAD, offering methadone, condoms and clean needles with money from its AIDS prevention budget and training from UNODC and various international partners, including from the US and France.\n\n\"When I came in 2015,\" says Mbodj, \"it allowed me to slow my life down a little bit and have time for myself to think about things.\"\n\nLater that year and with money from the country's National AIDS Council -- CLNS -- Mbodj was able to launch a community group for addicts, Sant\u00e9 Espoir Vie (SEV), which translates as \"health, hope, life.\"\n\nThe nonprofit operates independently of CEPIAD but a few members, including Mbodj, are paid mediators recruiting new patients for the clinic.\n\nThese mediators network the city's high drug-use areas every day to connect with addicts. There are 12 mediators that go out in teams of two.\n\n\"When we go into these drug hotspots people are very comfortable with us because we used to be users.

They assume without it they'd still be using, in prison perhaps, or worse.\n\n\"For me at least it saved my life,\" says one woman, 33, who didn't want to be identified because she fears for her safety.\n\nShe would burn through 100,000 West African CFA francs ($175) worth of cocaine a day, funded through prostitution.\n\nA musician friend introduced her to crack cocaine at a club when she was 20.

In 2013, she was jailed for 15 days for begging in public.\n\n\"I wasn't looking for help. All I was thinking about was just getting money and smoking.\"\n\nShe was at risk because of the unprotected sex and the violence that came with a drug-fueled lifestyle.\n\n\"At night sometimes thugs would follow us and steal our money, they would threaten us with knives and call us druggies,\" she says.\n\nIn 2015, she became very ill. When her sister took her to the hospital she was referred to CEPIAD for treatment and was diagnosed as HIV positive. Initially when she started treatment with counseling and drug substitution she relapsed and would still use cocaine.\n\n\"I made an agreement with the doctor that if I get married I am going to completely stop,\" she says. \"I've been married one year and eight months.

Then she met outreach workers from CEPIAD who offered her an alternative.\n\n\"I have been coming every day for two-and-a-half years.\"\n\nComprehensive treatment\n\nAt CEPIAD, psychologists and doctors provide counseling, HIV services, skills workshops and help with reintegrating into family networks.\n\nPeer support workers who are themselves former drug users also offer help along the journey to a drug-free life.\n\n\"All of those things are a good part of a comprehensive approach to treatment,\" says Robin Clark, a professor in the Departments of Family Medicine and Community Health and Quantitative Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts. He focuses on substance abuse and primary care.\n\nAs well as arts therapy, counseling is available to get addicts back into work.\n\nIt is crucial for such clinics to move beyond medication, he says of the use of methadone.\n\n\"There are a lot of psychosocial support just around daily living that really good effective centers try to offer to help people re-enter normal life after they have been unemployed, many people have been in prison,\" says Clark.\n\nApart from Senegal, Tanzania, Kenya and Mauritius are among the only eight countries in Africa offering 'harm reduction' approaches due to lack of funding and preference for faith-based and traditional healers.\n\n\"There are still challenges,\" admits Mbayang Fall Bousso, CEPIAD's health coordinator, who calls herself the organization's temple guardian.\n\n\"It's still only in Dakar and inside a hospital so not many people know it exists.\"\n\nThose making the daily commute face logistical challenges and she wants the clinic to run nationally.\n\n\"This way we can be able to reach out to those who are still not able or willing to come,\" says Bousso. \"To reduce the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B, TB and of course to reduce the amount of users.\"\n\nSince CEPIAD opened, more than 700 addicts have sought reprieve here.

So, if I loaf about during the day, they are watching me,\" he says with a chuckle.\n\nHenderson's family has farmed in Besters, a cattle district of rolling grassland hills and acacia trees, for five generations.\n\n\"History is complicated in South Africa,\" I remark to him. \"Our forebears took land from people. If not always directly, it was certainly helped by the legislation of the previous government. What do you think of that part of your legacy?\"\n\n\"We can't ignore that. I don't think commercial farmers should atone for all the sins of apartheid that were committed,\" he says.\n\nIn Besters, the farmers are grappling hands-on with one of South Africa's most challenging historical problems.\n\nWhen Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress came to power in South Africa in 1994, one of the key dilemmas they faced was the so-called land question.\n\nThe policy of pushing non-white South Africans off the land to the benefit of whites officially began with the 1913 Native Lands Act, though in reality the practice stretches back centuries.\n\nThe act limited black ownership to just 7% of the land. The vast majority of viable land was allotted to whites.\n\n71-year-old Wilson Shabalala's land claim was finally granted, only to see the government official in charge of the transfer take the farm for himself.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa recently described the Lands Act as South Africa's \"original sin.\"\n\n\"In my own family it happened twice, where land was taken, we were moved from where my parents had grown up owning land, working the land, they were moved and dropped into an arid place with no compensation whatsoever,\" said Ramaphosa in an exclusive interview with CNN.\n\n\"As it is now, the poverty that we have in South Africa, in part, has been given rise to by people not having assets.\"\n\nThis racist geography was accelerated during the apartheid years, when legislation codified the nationalist party's aims to keep races physically separated. Blacks and mixed-race South Africans were removed from cities and pushed into townships or homelands -- land allotted to non-whites, according to their ethnic identity.\n\nThey had to have a passbook, a kind of internal passport, to travel to designated white areas.\n\nIn Ladysmith, the nearest town to Besters, the \"black spots\" in town were erased in the 1970s, the non-white families forced out to a township called Ezakheni, some 15 miles away.\n\nWith the advent of democracy, land redistribution was, in theory, a top priority. But the South African government's efforts have been beset by problems.\n\nThe farmers in Besters didn't wait for them to rectify the past.\n\nIn our district I have seven neighbors and they are all different colors ... there's place in the sun for us all. Roland Henderson, farmer\n\nMore than a decade ago, the commercial farmers in Besters held hundreds of meetings with the local community. As a result, with the help of government money, they have redistributed almost half of their district's land.\n\n\"It's complicated and there are many layers of history and many layers of conflict, but if you put everybody around a table and you talk to each other openly and honestly, you can find each other,\" says Henderson.\n\nEmerging farmers like Ndizane Khosa have used their new land to raise cattle, chickens and sheep, and access to capital has allowed them to pull their families out of poverty.\n\nFarmers like Ndizane Khosa have used their new land to pull their families out of poverty.\n\n\"When we were growing up we had no idea how this farming worked, but our grandkids have the opportunity to learn properly now. I can pass that knowledge to them,\" Khosa says.\n\n\"In our district I have seven neighbors and they are all different colors, but we live happily together and there's place in the sun for us all,\" says Henderson.\n\nThe success of land redistribution in Besters is the anomaly, not the norm.\n\nExhaustive studies show that the ANC-led government has failed to execute its policy of land restitution and redistribution because of corruption, mismanagement and a lack of will. The vast majority of private land -- farmland included -- is owned by whites.\n\n\"A lot is at stake,\" said Ramaphosa. \"You could even say that the stability of the country is at stake. And I am not fond of failing at anything. And this issue we will not fail on.\"\n\nThe ANC, pushed by an insurgent opposition party on the left, has resolved to amend the constitution to explicitly allow land redistribution without compensation. It is a highly contentious move that is working through a parliamentary process.\n\nHenderson's agreement to hand over some of his property is an anomaly rather than the norm.\n\nWhile Henderson, Khosa and the other farmers of Besters managed to broker a negotiated future for the land in their rural slice of South Africa, they are facing new pressures to take sides in the land debate.\n\nThey say the extremes could scupper the experiment of a democratic South Africa.\n\n\"We are getting drowned out by the rhetoric and by the noise of the politicians and the noise of others,\" says Henderson on the balcony of his farmhouse. \"It is difficult to galvanize the middle, because we tend to be more silent than the extremes.

All the tests needed. You can get them quicker if you do it privately,\" Borg explained. \"At the public hospital, there are always between 20 to 30 people waiting ahead of you.\"\n\nIt took six months to get a diagnosis, and by that time, she needed surgery.\n\nThankfully, the 74-year-old recalls, a friend had advised her to ask about a project run by surgeons that help breast cancer patients get their surgery quicker on the public health system: Project Flamingo.\n\nWithin two weeks, Borg was scheduled for surgery. She had a double mastectomy in September, 2018.\n\nDr Liana Roodt operating on a patient and assisted by Dr Michael Brombacher.\n\n\"They saw that the [surgery] list was too long, so they formed Project Flamingo,\" Borg said. \"They gave up their own time on a Saturday to do these operations.\"\n\nBreast cancer is often detected at a late stage, with one study finding that the time to diagnosis in Cape Town was on average 8\u00bd months.

It means that by operating alone you won't cure that person of cancer.

The ratio in the United States is 36.\n\nWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the A 2018 report by NOIPolls, a local polling company and advocacy group Nigeria HealthWatch, noted that there were 72,000 nationally registered Nigerian doctors, according to the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria, but only 35,000 practice in the country.\n\nMany doctors have emigrated to practice in the UK and US, the report notes.\n\nIn Ghana, Dr. Verna Vanderpuye, a consultant clinical oncologist at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, says it is hard to find the competency. \"The quality of cancer surgeries is also very important,\" she said, suggesting that surgical skills are limited in rural areas.\n\nBoth Rayne and Vanderpuye admit that persuading patients to have a mastectomy is also difficult.\n\n\"For young women, there's the fact that when they have a mastectomy, they only have one breast, and some, they lose their spouses and their position in the society,\" Vanderpuye said.\n\nIn a 2018 study , she found that a fear of mastectomy was the primary reason Ghanaian women present with advance stages of the disease.\n\nFear of treatment was also among the reasons why some women in South Africa had advanced breast cancer.\n\nAmy MacFarlane, a final year medical student closes a wound after operation.\n\nFeeling like a woman\n\n\"In an ideal setting, psychological support, counseling and even practical things like bereavement counseling are super important but seen as a luxury right now,\" Roodt said.\n\nIn South Africa, Project Flamingo started distributing pampering packs to patients that included bathroom essentials, magazines and beauty treats, all for free.\n\nSo far, 4,500 packs have been given away by Roodt and her colleagues and friends.\n\n\"We were trying to show that even though being in hospital can be a daunting experience and you see us running around the wards, we actually do care. ...

But some of those stomas can be reversed after a period of time,\" she said.\n\n\"Imagine having a poo bag attached for two to five years and dealing with a stoma when you are living in a shack with no electricity and no running water,\" Roodt said. \"It's a complete nightmare. It's not good enough to just take care of the cancer but the quality of life is terrible.\"\n\n\"There is a part of me that is hopeful of there not being a need for Project Flamingo,\" she said. \"For a health-care system that is equal and fairer.\"\n\nThat is a \"pipe dream\" for now, she realizes, and so the project will continue to run for as long as it is needed.\n\nOn the unexpected success of the project, Roodt added: \"The amazing thing is the power of human stories.

If you know any gays, report them to me,\" said Paul Makonda in a news conference with local reporters last Monday. The task force was supposed to be launched this Monday. So far it is unclear if the governor's deadline is being met. Multiple attempts by CNN to reach Makonda were unsuccessful. \"It is extremely regrettable that Tanzania has chosen to take such a dangerous path in its handling of an already marginalized group of people,\" said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International's regional director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes. \"The idea of this task force must be immediately abandoned as it only serves to incite hatred among members of the public.\" Central government not on board On Sunday, after intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans. \"His views are not the view of the government. The state would like to use this opportunity to assure people that it will continue to respect all organizations that are relating to human rights,\" a Foreign Ministry statement said. The statement did not criticize the governor's actions, nor reassure gay Tanzanians of protection. \"If the government really means it, then they should stop these actions by Makonda. Otherwise the harassment and fear will just continue,\" the LGBT activist said. Ouma said that until they get guarantees of protection, people will just remain in hiding. \"I need the government's assurance that I will not be attacked,\" he said. Tanzanian President John Magufuli's government has tried to distance itself from the regional official's stance. Tanzania is a deeply conservative country and, unlike in neighboring Kenya, hasn't seen progress on LGBT rights. On the contrary, under the current administration of John Magufuli, rights groups believe that the situation has gotten worse. Human Rights Watch says the government has shut down LGBT-friendly clinics, prohibited community organizations from doing HIV outreach targeting key populations and arrested activists holding workshops on legal advice. LGBT people face a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzanian for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. But the prospect of a task force scouring the streets and social media accounts for \"evidence\" of LGBT Tanzanians has terrified many in the community already dealing with a homophobic community and government. But the activists contacted by CNN say they refuse to leave. \"I have to help people who are in hiding. The government needs to stop this harassment.

Paystack's attempt to solve that problem was to provide a website link for secure online payments. \"We took it a step further, realizing that most businesses don't have access to developers and built a simple tool that allows a business [to] create a payment link they can add on their website or share with their customers on social without needing a developer.\" Follow CNN Africa on social media See more stories on Marketplace Africa and share your thoughts with us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Now, according to the startup's CEO, \"businesses can start accepting payments in less than 30 mins.\" \"We started Paystack because we believe that better payment tools are one of the most important things that African businesses need to unlock their explosive potential,\" Akinlade says. That aim has helped the company raise over $10 million dollars in funding over the last two years. Paystack says it now processes nearly 15% of all online payments in Africa's largest economy - Nigeria, with $20 million in transactions paid out to merchants in August 2018. Investment potential That same month, Paystack announced that it raised $8 million in a round of funding led by Stripe - another payments processing company which processed more than half of all American transactions in 2017.

But according to the World Bank, half of Sub-Saharan Africa's population do not use official financial services. Providing financial services for people without a bank account is Paystack's next aim. \"We're investing heavily in making available all types of local and regional payment channels beyond card payments to ensure that customers can pay however they feel most comfortable,\" Akinlade says. Some of its biggest investors are certain that by exploring offline payment systems like QR codes, Paystack can bring the rest of Africa into global online trade. \"Our investment in Paystack aligns with the kind of investments we look for -- those that will help extend our reach into the global commerce ecosystem as it changes and grows, and that will provide mutually beneficial business opportunities,\" said Otto Williams, head for strategic partnerships, fintechs and ventures for Visa in Central & Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA), in a statement.

But still Craig Foster slips into the frigid water every day, without a wetsuit or scuba gear, off to explore an underwater kingdom.\n\nSome might call him reckless -- in the past, Foster, a filmmaker, has dived with Nile crocodiles in Botswana's Okavango Delta and swum with great white sharks. But for the past eight years, he has turned his attention to a vast underwater kelp forest off the west coast of South Africa where he spends his days tracking sea creatures.\n\nHe has now published a book, along with fellow diver Ross Frylinck, documenting his close encounters with these wild animals.\n\nThe book, \"Sea Change: Primal Joy and the art of underwater tracking,\" details how he touched a cat shark on its \"nose\" before it lay relaxed in his hands \"tame as a puppy.\" It describes how an enormous stingray wrapped its wings around him for a few frightening seconds, and how a Cape clawless otter reached out to touch his face.\n\nBut his most memorable encounter was with an octopus he befriended and accompanied on hunts.\n\nFoster said it took years of diving and learning how to completely relax around animals before they started engaging with him. Sea Change Project\n\nFoster's octopus even made a cameo on the BBC's \"Blue Planet II\" documentary last year, where it demonstrated an impressive camouflage technique in which it grabs shells and stones to build a temporary armored shell around itself to ward off small predators.\n\nThis is just one of dozens of never-seen-before behavioral traits that Foster has witnessed on his dives. He has discovered seven new species, including a shrimp that was named after him: Heteromysis Fosteri.\n\nDangers in the deep\n\nUnsurprisingly, Foster doesn't fear the bigger beasts that patrol the sea forest.\n\n\"Certainly (it is scary) if you're not expecting it and a big white shark is there in front of you and the water is murky,\" he told CNN. \"But to be honest there's very little to fear from the animals, they are not the danger.\"\n\nOver the years Foster has taken thousands of intimate photos of wildlife, including this extreme close up of a pyjama catshark's eye.

It is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, providing food, shelter and the ideal habitat for various species including endangered sea snails called abalone, the Cape fur seal and a variety of shark species.\n\nFoster believes that if he can get others to think of this sea forest as one of the natural wonders of the world, much like the Great Barrier Reef , they will be inspired to conserve it.\n\nMarine scientist Kerry Sink is leading the charge to protect South Africa's unique and threatened offshore marine life.\n\nProtecting underwater worlds\n\nBut Foster also stressed the need for marine protected areas to further conserve South Africa's waters.\n\nLast month, South Africa's Department of Environmental Affairs approved the declaration of 20 marine protected areas, collectively covering 50,000 square kilometers.

The drone will then establish whether the boat is operating inside a marine protected area, and if it is an authorized fishing vessel.\n\nIf it concludes that the activity is illegal, the drone will register the boat's location, identification number, and number of people on board and relay this information to authorities via satellite.\n\nCurrently governments employ light aircraft or coast guard vessels for this kind of surveillance.\n\n\"With artificial intelligence we are able to replace the pilot, the data analyst, transmission equipment, and with that we can reduce the cost,\" says Idrissi, a former account manager at Microsoft.\n\nHe adds that using drones guided by AI would relieve coast guards from their monitoring duties and allow them to focus on intercepting vessels.\n\nAccording to Idrissi, ATLAN Space technology can be integrated in any type of drone. He says the operational range could reach up to 800 kilometers when using drones equipped with a combustion engine.\n\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's a drone powered by artificial intelligence.\n\nIdrissi, 37 and co-founder Younes Moumen, 35, both based in Rabat, started developing the technology when they learned that illegal fishing costs coastal countries in West Africa approximately $2.3 billion every year.\n\n\"We consider ourselves a partner of government to build a sustainable solution to the issues and challenges they are facing,\" Idrissi says.\n\nDrones for good\n\nATLAN Space is one of many startups innovating with drone technology on the continent.\n\nIn Rwanda, drones deliver vital medical supplies like blood and vaccines to remote areas.\n\nPhotos: In Dubai, Exponent Technology Services collaborated with aviation authorities on a new tracking system helping prevent drones entering no-fly zones.

The meeting on Saturday between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 Summit in Buenos Ares is the place to make that happen.\n\nTo his credit, President Trump is taking important steps to minimize security concerns arising from certain Chinese investment and technology acquisition practices. Now, he must find a way forward that allows American businesses to participate in the world's fastest-growing economy with as much fairness, openness and transparency as possible.\n\nThe tariff actions have put pressure on a Chinese economy that was already under some stress. But tariffs have also served as a tax on American consumers and businesses, and reciprocal tariffs from China are hurting American farmers, ranchers and manufacturers. Saturday's meeting is the opportunity for the two presidents to abandon these damaging tariffs in favor of a framework for fair trade and investment.\n\nA truly successful meeting between President Trump and President Xi would result in three outcomes.\n\n1. China would announce near-term moves that would address long-standing areas of concern, such as intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer, or the practice of requiring that foreign companies share their technology to do business in China. For example, China could issue a public statement recognizing that it will take immediate actions to quickly resolve a number of ongoing cases involving IP theft and discrimination affecting US companies. It could also establish permanent solutions that protect US intellectual property against theft, forced transfer and infringement. These actions could stave off January's planned tariff increase.\n\nRead More\n\n2. Presidents Trump and Xi should announce that senior officials will immediately open negotiations to develop a comprehensive, enduring commercial agreement. In our view, these negotiations should last less than six months, and the two sides should aim to eliminate all tariffs within that timeframe.

Instead, and especially under the strongman leadership of Xi, China has stuck to market economics but clamped down on political freedoms.\n\nBeijing is now seeking to impose its weight on its own region and beyond, making sweeping territorial claims in the South China Sea, sparking concerns of accidental clashes between the US and Chinese navies.\n\nAfter decades of discrete and careful diplomacy, it is now seeking to extend its political, military and economic influence into Europe and Africa and offers developing nations an alternative model to the West's liberalized societies.\n\nAs a result, there are growing fears that the rising superpower could clash with the existing dominant global force, the United States, and the Xi-Trump summit takes place as anxiety mounts over a possible new, pan-Pacific Cold War.\n\nSuspicion of China is rare bipartisan concern\n\nWhile Trump lashed out at China on the campaign trail, and blames it for draining away millions of American industrial jobs, rising suspicion of Beijing's motives is bipartisan and widely shared in the foreign policy community.\n\nThe Trump administration's new National Security Strategy named China, along with Russia as a \"revisionist power\" seeking a world \"antithetical to US values and interests.\" It said China wants to displace the US in the Indo-Pacific region and reorder its economic structure to suit its own interests.\n\nIn July, Michael Collins, deputy assistant director of the CIA's East Asia Mission Center said China was using legal and illicit, public, private, military and economic power to wage a \"cold war\" against the United States.\n\nVice President Mike Pence formalized the US turn from engagement to confrontation in a speech in Washington in October.\n\n\"America had hoped that economic liberalization would bring China into a greater partnership with us and with the world. Instead, China has chosen economic aggression, which has in turn emboldened its growing military,\" Pence said.\n\nGiven this backdrop, an agreement on the US-China trade dispute, while welcome, would be only a small step to defusing a building competition between the two great economies.\n\nMiles Kahler, senior fellow for Global Governance at the Council on Foreign Relations, said US-China relations are undergoing a transformation under Trump.\n\n\"It doesn't mean open hostility or some sort of new Cold War, yet, but the list of grievances that they have with China is very, very long and it's well beyond trade,\" Kahler said.\n\n\"The consensus has definitely shifted toward a much harder, much less accommodating line toward China. And this is not just the result of changes in politics in the United States; I think it's a result of perceptions of where Chinese policy has gone under President Xi Jinping in the last few years,\" he said.\n\nA rising challenger?\n\nThe US shift is not just evident in Pence's speech. Washington now refers to Asia-Pacific as the Indo-Pacific region, highlighting the role of its ally India, a rising challenger to Beijing. At the G20 summit in Argentina, Trump held a meeting and an unsubtle photo op aimed at China alongside the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nUnderlining naval tensions, the US this week sent a guided-missile cruiser on the latest \"freedom of navigation\" exercise in the South China Sea, near the Paracel islands, that are claimed by Beijing.\n\nAnd earlier this month at the APEC summit in Papua New Guinea, Trump offered China an opening by not showing up. The China-US confrontation cast a shadow over the event which featured hawkish speeches by Xi and Pence.\n\nBoth sides do have common interests in preventing an outburst of conflict and Trump has often enlisted China's help in reining in its recalcitrant ally North Korea during his stick-and-carrot charm offensive.\n\nBut Washington and its regional allies have condemned Beijing's recent drive to establish claims and build military bases on islands and reefs in the South China Sea whose waters are claimed by multiple nations.\n\nHope for a deal\n\nJUST WATCHED China: next target in Trump trade wars?

No modern President has been as tough on Beijing with his rhetoric and with tariff policy than Trump. Yet he also often boasts of his relationship with Xi, calling him a good friend. There are also concerns among Trump critics that he gives away the store in on-one-one negotiations.\n\nGoing into the talks, Trump's economic team was talking a tough game. Larry Kudlow, director of the US National Economic Council, said that the President was ready to slap $267 billion in new tariffs on China, and took a swipe at Beijing's economy.\n\n\"Most observers believe China to be in a slump whereas the United States is in a strong solid position going into the summit,\" he said.\n\nDeepening splits\n\nJUST WATCHED White House trade adviser: Ball's in China's court Replay More Videos ...

Chinese consumers may decide to stop buying American products too -- in China and abroad.\n\nIn fact, Tiffany just warned this week in its latest quarterly earnings report that it was being hurt by a slowdown in spending by Chinese tourists at its US and Hong Kong locations. The stock plunged on the news.\n\nBut Tiffany didn't seem to think that anti-American sentiment was the reason for tourists pulling back.

The President has openly expressed his fondness for hearing differing points of view on trade, and has fostered the intra-administration disputes that have marked his policy toward China. More moderate aides such as Mnuchin and National Economic Council chairman Larry Kudlow have advocated for easing trade tensions with China, offering warnings that escalating the trade war would only make matters worse, and allow Trump's critics to pin even more of the blame for a shaky economy on him. That had led to greater confidence among some advisers that Saturday's dinner with Xi could produce a breakthrough, even though no official has been willing to explicitly say they expect the two men to come to an agreement.

After 20 days and over 50 hours of play, finally there was a result.\n\nFor most of November there was deadlock. Twelve games, 12 draws, a too-close-to-call psychological battle conducted before a devoted global audience locked at 6-6. And so, in a soundproof studio in a grand Victorian building in central London, the world championship was decided by a series of quickfire tie-breakers for the first time in the competition's official 132-year history.\n\nThis was, said World Chess president Ilya Merenzon, the chess equivalent of Muhammad Ali versus Joe Frazer going into the final round, though perish the thought that those two heavyweights had taken 51 hours and 773 moves to settle the \"Fight of the Century.\"\n\nCarlsen, the world No.1, the reigning champion, a 27-year-old who was once described by the Washington Post as the \"Mozart of chess,\" was the favorite to prevail in the best-of-four rapid match.\n\nNot only is the Norwegian regarded as one of the greats in the classical format, he's also the world's top-ranked rapid and top-rated blitz player. This was a man going into the final day with a nine-from-nine record in tie-breakers spanning over a decade, and so it should be of little surprise that Carlsen crushed his opponent 3-0 in the shortened format.\n\n\"I feel like I've had a really good day at work today,\" joked a smiling Carlsen to the delight of a chuckling crowd of fans and reporters.\n\nCarlsen and Caruana had drawn all 12 classic games\n\nThe buildup to the grand finale had escalated into a crescendo of excitement, so closely contested had the first 12 games been. But when fireworks were anticipated, a wet Wednesday in London served up a damp squib as the tie-breakers proved a challenge too far for the American grandmaster.\n\n\"It wasn't a good day for me,\" he admitted. \"I hope I can look back at the match and learn from it.\"\n\nCaruana -- the challenger, the underdog, the first American to compete for the world title since Bobby Fischer in 1972 -- had not blinked during the three-week stare-off.\n\nBut though the difference between Caruana and Carlsen in the classical games was razor-thin -- Carlsen would later say that the American was equally worthy of calling himself the world's best in the longer format of the game -- the New Yorker's rankings in rapid and blitz (No.8 and No.16 respectively) suggested that he would eventually fold in the English capital.\n\nCarlsen is the highest-rated chess player in history\n\n'Stupid opinions'\n\nThe Norwegian's hasty offer of a draw in Monday's Game 12 had led to question marks about the defending champion's confidence and courage.\n\nFormer world No.1 Garry Kasparov, the only other grandmaster to match Carlsen's global fame, had tweeted that the \"shocking draw\" had led him to reevaluate. \"Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his,\" wrote Kasparov.\n\nBut Carlsen, though not at his best over the last two years, held his nerve and, following his victory, told the assembled media and fans that the likes of Kasparov were \"entitled to their stupid opinions.\"\n\nThe crowd watch Fabiano Caruana and Magnus Carlsen take part in the final\n\nNot since 1990 had there been a chess match between players this closely ranked. \"Fabiano is a really strong player and there's not much to choose between us at this point,\" Carlsen admitted.\n\nAnd not since the brilliant Fischer, the first western world champion in the modern era, took on Soviet Boris Spassky at the height of the Cold War in 1972 in a clash of east versus west had there been such international interest.\n\nOn the eve of the title decider, tickets were being sold online for \u00a3125 (US$160). An hour or so before the 3pm start for the first of the 25-minute tie-breakers, an orderly queue formed outside The College, a spectacular old building in the Holborn district of London.\n\nThe predominantly male spectators comprised of the young and old and came from around the world, representing a fraction of the enthusiastic following the live online and TV coverage had attracted this month.\n\nCarlsen poses with the FIDE world chess championship trophy\n\nTo truly measure the appeal of an event is to scan the number of journalists and photographers in attendance. One room was not enough to home the media sprawl.\n\nThe BBC had dispatched a correspondent for a bulletin on that evening's primetime news show, and since the beginning of November a pack of Norwegian journalists had descended on the English capital to cover Carlsen's every move. During the post-match press conference, the World Chess president drew attention to the handful of American reporters in attendance, a rare sight over the last few decades.\n\nThe unprecedented spate of draws had left many to question whether the format of the tournament needed to change. Had it been dull, or were these two geniuses playing at an extraordinarily high standard? The president of World Chess, unsurprisingly, pleaded the latter.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to give people the opportunity to criticize something otherwise it'll be really boring for them,\" Merenzon told CNN Sport.\n\n\"Overall, we're very happy and we see that chess is becoming a household sport and this is exactly what we want. Even though the result [after 12 games] was a draw, the fight was intense.\"\n\nNo matter the level of understanding of a game which has more possible situations than there are atoms in the universe, few spectacles are more compelling than watching two humans in a unidirectional glass booth vying for a crown which has been owned by only a handful of men. Carlsen is just the 16th world champion.\n\nSitting at either side of a square table, barely a meter apart, these grandmasters with superhuman powers of concentration played as if unaware that on the other side of the glass would be an audience of hundreds seated in a darkened room; peering, filming, picture-taking (though phones were officially not allowed); behaving as if the boxed finalists were a rare caged species to be gawped at.\n\n\"Magnus played very well so all credit to him,\" said Caruana\n\nIt was Dutch grandmaster Hans Ree who once said that chess was a game beautiful enough to waste your life for. It is certainly a game for those who believe Test cricket or baseball to be hurried and short-lived.\n\nWorld Chess will now attempt to build on the popularity of these twentysomething grandmasters, whose rivalry has helped elevate this event to a wider audience. As Caruana's agent, Eric Kuhn, told CNN Sport at the start of the tournament, the players \"represent everything that is now.\"\n\nWith the game particularly popular with teenagers in Asia, World Chess is already in talks with Chinese companies in a bid to expand further in the world's most populous country. For this edition of the championship, a Tinder-style app was developed to unite like-minded chess enthusiasts and World Chess has plans to introduce more gaming apps over the next few weeks.\n\n\"We know for a fact that while the championship is happening it's going to be crazy, the only upsetting part is it's really hard to convince people before,\" added Merenzon.\n\n\"We have so much planned for the digital space and we'll be rolling it out in the next weeks.

His greatness is assured.\n\n\"I will celebrate for the next two years,\" said the Norwegian when asked how he planned to toast his victory.\n\nBut though there can only be one champion, both have galvanized the game.

In fact, his whereabouts are currently unknown. He skipped out early of the very event where he presented his research amid calls for a probe into this work. The Chinese authorities have opened an \"immediate investigation\" into He and ordered those involved in the project to suspend their activities\n\nEditing the DNA of human embryos that go on to deliver has never been done before. And with good reason, scientists say. The technology is still in its infancy and could lead to a multitude of unknown genetic complications later in life.\n\nScientists have reached an understanding that implanting such an embryo is a boundary that shouldn't be crossed until the risks are reduced or eliminated. \"No one expected that someone would do this experiment on a human embryo,\" Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of the gene-editing technique CRISPR and member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard told CNN. \"The scientific community didn't actually know anything about what was going on.\"\n\nHe, a professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said he was \"proud\" of his work that resulted in two ostensibly healthy twin girls born from embryos altered to make them resistant to HIV. But he was condemned by his peers and the experiment was labeled \"monstrous,\" \"unethical,\" and a \"huge blow\" to the reputation of Chinese biomedical research.\n\nThat He could tinker with life changing technology away from the eyes of regulators and purportedly even the university where he conducted the experiment, has raised serious ethical questions around the transparency of gene editing and sparked calls for a globally binding code of conduct.\n\nThe case also places renewed scrutiny on China, a leader in the field of genome editing and biotechnology that has historically had a reputation for sidestepping ethical questions in favor of innovation.\n\nBut deeper questions are being asked as to whether it is now inevitable that this technology will be used in the future.\n\n\"Never before have humans had power like this over our own biology,\" Hurlbut said. \"We are now in the era of germline genetic engineering.\"\n\nChinese scientist He Jiankui in a discussion with head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute, Robin Lovell-Badge.\n\n'A wake up call'\n\nUltimately, genome editing shows huge promise in one day treating diseases that are currently untreatable, such as sickle cell disease, or cystic fibrosis. But scientists at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing , where He appeared on Wednesday, overwhelmingly said the science needed to be made as effective and safe as possible -- and it was \"irresponsible\" to use germline editing in a clinical setting at this stage.\n\nGermline gene-editing refers to genetic changes in every cell, that will be passed on to future generations. This is different to somatic (body) cell gene-editing, whereby only existing cells are targeted and the changes made are not passed on to future offspring.\n\nApart from raising ethical concerns, scientists said the gene He \"edited-out,\" called CCR5, is crucial to the human immune system, and removing it increases the risk of susceptibility to other diseases such as the West Nile virus and influenza. Other critics pointed to the fact that the procedure was not medically necessary as there are other treatments for HIV.\n\nMaking changes to an embryo could also have unknown consequences that could be passed down to future generations.\n\nIt was evident that He had not fully considered the potential long-term social effects on the twin girls. When one audience member at the summit asked whether He had thought about how the girls would see themselves and how they would be treated by society, he replied: \"I don't know how to answer this question.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED CRISPR co-inventor slams Chinese scientist behind \"world's first gene-edited babies\" Replay More Videos ...

Dzau, President of the Institute of Medicine at the US National Academy of Medicine.\n\nLast year, China spent a record 1.76 trillion yuan ($254 billion) on research and development , and the country is catching up with the US' investment in the same area, spurring a genetic arms race that has been labeled \"Sputnik 2.0\" by Dr. Carl June, an immunotherapy specialist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd Chinese regulators appear more open to the new tech than its US counterparts. As of the end of February 2018, there were nine registered clinical studies testing CRISPR-edited cells to treat various cancers and HIV infection in China, according to Goldman Sachs analysis in April. That's compared to one in the US after the Food and Drug Administration lifted its hold on the first US-based human CRISPR trial in October.\n\n\"It's clear that this is the new frontier,\" said Herv\u00e9 Chneiweiss of France's Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique. \"It's clearly the gold rush on any kind of new knowledge that could be translated into new treatments.\"\n\nMany of these treatments exist in a legal gray area. Currently, each country has their own rules and regulations surrounding gene-editing. China has several loosely-worded regulations restricting experimental science, including rules on embryo research. A 2003 directive to in-vitro clinics by the Chinese Ministry of Health barred \"clinical experiments\" that \"violate ethical or moral principles.\"\n\n\"The problem is there are no penalties\" if the guidelines are breached, said Renzong Qiu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.\n\nJUST WATCHED What is CRISPR Cas9 gene editing?

Clinical use of genetic editing 'irresponsible' Scientists reiterated an agreement made at the previous conference in 2015, that said it would be irresponsible to use such genetic editing until safety issues had been dealt with. \"While we applaud the rapid advance of somatic gene editing into clinical trials, we continue to believe that proceeding with any clinical use of germline editing remains irresponsible at this time,\" the statement said.

That would be catastrophic. International relief organizations and humanitarian observers have largely unfettered access to the camps in Bangladesh and can offer support both to the refugees.

In the long run, it may in principle be possible to allow for the Rohingya to return to Myanmar. But before that can be even contemplated, Myanmar must change. The country must overhaul its 1982 Citizenship Law which rendered the Rohingya stateless. They must receive the same status and the same legal rights and protections as everyone else in the country. In addition, the individuals inside Burmese institutions and civil society organizations who orchestrated this genocide must be fired and held accountable before international tribunals. But the highest priority must be given to ensuring the safety of the remaining Rohingya people. And realistically, for the foreseeable future their safety can only be ensured by the international community -- who only have access to Bangladesh, not Rakhine State. To that end, the international community must work together with Bangladesh to invest in the refugee communities and in Bangladesh itself so the Rohingya and Bangladesh can together build a sustainable, thriving community.

Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Donald Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.\n\nThis week, I offer a special briefing in advance of Trump's participation at the G20 summit in Argentina.\n\nIf you give a mouse a cookie\n\nFrom Russian President Vladimir Putin's perspective, the Michael Cohen bombshell exposing his lies about your alleged Russian business dealings could not have come at a better time.\n\nPutin probably thinks that you're entering the G20 worried about your exposure to the Special Counsel. He may even think he has leverage over you because he knows the truth about what may actually have happened between Russia and members of your campaign. Despite your denial of wrongdoing , we assess that he thinks he knows all the dirty little secrets about who he worked with and when.\n\nWhile he may have been itching for a repeat of your meeting in Helsinki -- it could have been a chance for him to score points at home when his domestic approval ratings are falling -- you citing Ukraine as the reason for canceling your meeting doesn't hold a lot of water. While you are canceling a meeting with him for violating Ukraine's sovereignty, you went ahead with meeting him in Helsinki despite his violation of US sovereignty via election interference.\n\nCanceling (or postponing) the meeting is also signaling to Putin that you'll give him a relatively free pass on Ukraine. This is a diplomatic slap on the wrist for Putin. He knows that past presidents haven't viewed bilateral meetings as simple photo-ops -- but as opportunities to deliver tough messages. In a one-on-one meeting, you could have delivered a clear message about the actual costs for his misbehavior -- including more sanctions and/or NATO enhancements.\n\nEven without a meeting, expect Putin and his team to use their digital army and public statements to continue cooking up their favorite Russian recipe -- scapegoating imaginary political forces for everything Russia is actually doing wrong. He said that the recent clash with Ukraine was a political stunt by Ukrainian President Poreshenko. And because he knows that your Twitter feed and public remarks are often filled with ire, he'll likely rely on his favorite tactic of blaming US political forces, rather than himself, for any deterioration in the bilateral relationship.\n\nHis goal is probably to divert your attention from punitive measures for his ongoing aggression and to refocus you on your usual suspects -- Democrats, Robert Mueller and your perceived \"unfair\" treatment by other countries. But, if you give Putin any wiggle room, he'll just continue to push (with all kinds of force) for more.\n\nNo points for just showing up\n\nG20 leaders may view your arrival in Argentina as a huge cost to the summit. Why? Because they fear a repeat of your previous summit performances -- such as when you insulted world leaders at a gathering of NATO or refused to sign the G7's communique in Ottawa.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump's take on diplomacy as he heads to G20 Replay More Videos ...

They are expecting you to make unilateral statements about what America wants and what America needs -- rather than what's good for international stability.\n\nWhile much attention will be focused on your bilateral engagements, a decision to insult the body of the G20, its host or its members could stoke more concerns about US isolationism.\n\nMaking a murderer\n\nAfter you broke with our allies and issued a unilateral statement proclaiming that, despite the horrific murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the United States should continue doing business with Saudi Arabia, your posture toward Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will be the focus of much discussion at the G20. Any moves you make to embrace him further -- literally and figuratively -- will be perceived as emboldening him to murder again (even if MBS still denies any involvement).\n\nAny public display of affection you show for MBS -- even if he offers you a carrot , like agreeing not to advocate further on oil production cuts -- may be interpreted as standing with Saudi Arabia and against our other allies, like Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (whom you are scheduled to see) and European countries who have pledged to cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia. However, any coordinated measures you announce to punish Saudi Arabia -- even if not aimed at MBS himself -- could show a renewed interest in strengthening your (non-Saudi) alliances.\n\nYou should be aware that statements you make in Argentina criticizing recent congressional moves against the Kingdom will be viewed as further evidence that your real enemies list is made up of whomever doesn't vote your way -- and not perpetrators of actual crimes.\n\nNot a one-trick pony\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping probably knows that you have two goals in mind for your meeting with him this weekend: trying to maintain the image of your close personal relationship with him, while concurrently hammering China to at least publicly profess (like they did after your first meeting last year) that they'll be more flexible on trade issues so that you can declare even a temporary victory.\n\nXi has witnessed your tactics. He has seen you agree to a tariff cease-fire with the EU only to restart berating it again. And even if you agree to a US-China trade war moratorium temporarily, he probably thinks that more tariffs are a foregone conclusion, especially because of your team's recent findings of ongoing, egregious Chinese behavior\n\nWhile you highlight your leverage over China's economy, we want to flag that the Chinese Communist Party is not a one-trick pony. Your (sometimes) friend Xi is able to strike back with more than tariffs. Harassment of US businesses could increase along with harassment of US interests in the diplomatic and security space. China has ramped up its aggression against our ally Taiwan, and with a more pro-China party winning last week's Taiwanese election, China could increase efforts to hurt Taiwan's independence while concurrently upping its bullying tactics in the South China Sea and against US military assets.\n\nJUST WATCHED What to expect from US and China at G20 summit Replay More Videos ...

A Chinese scientist has claimed he has succeeded in editing the genes of twin girls, Lulu and Nana, in a medical first that is shocking -- for its secrecy, its needlessness and what it suggests about the culture of medical research in China.\n\nSince the debut of the biotechnology CRISPR-cas9 in 2012, this day seemed inevitable -- despite endless warnings from bioethicists and a wide variety of scientific bodies. Hours after the announcement that the twins were born \"a few weeks ago\" with modified DNA, the technique's co-creator Feng Zhang called for an immediate halt to such trials.\n\nCRISPR is a kind of search-and-destroy or search-and-replace for the human genome. Normally, RNA molecules, spawned through DNA transcription, serve as the blueprint for proteins. But by pairing RNA with the aid of a DNA cutting enzyme called cas9, the CRISPR technique can snip out a particular DNA sequence, turning off genes or replacing them with other DNA.\n\nAnd since scientists can easily generate an RNA pair for any sequence of DNA (the underlying biological code in each human cell), CRISPR has the potential to cure countless genetic diseases.\n\nBut the CRISPR technique isn't perfect , and in every few hundred cases, in what is referred to as \"off-target events,\" it can edit the wrong portion of DNA, potentially creating unwanted mutations.\n\nLess controversial trials are already underway involving humans after birth. This kind of gene editing revises somatic cells, the kind that are not passed on to our offspring.\n\nBut when a scientist edits the genes in an embryo prior to implantation into the womb, the germ line is altered. That means the laboratory edits could be passed along to all subsequent generations springing forth from this individual.\n\nJUST WATCHED What is CRISPR Cas9 gene editing? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What is CRISPR Cas9 gene editing? 01:50\n\nGermline editing is highly controversial but has been theoretically condoned under a range of strict criteria and regulations -- all of which include complete transparency within the experimental trial. (The one exception being the details of identification for the participants, which may be kept secret.)\n\nWhich is to say, no one wanted this kind of trial done in secret. But secrecy is exactly what the Chinese scientist appears to have chosen . He did not publicly announce his plans to conduct the trial or allow for the scientific community to debate its merits before announcing his findings this week.\n\nAnd, in that secrecy, Dr. He Jiankui of Shenzen's Southern University of Science and Technology went forward with an ethically flawed research plan, choosing to edit the gene CCR5, so that it was no longer functional. People without working CCR5 genes are more resistant to HIV infection. The researchers targeted couples in which one partner has HIV, offering the hope they can give birth to an HIV-free and HIV-resistant child.\n\nIn the case of the former, it's already possible to prevent HIV transmission via sperm washing and assisted fertilization. And, in the case of the latter, while gene editing might be effective in providing some degree of long-term HIV immunity, this has not been proven in humans yet.\n\nJUST WATCHED CRISPR co-inventor slams Chinese scientist behind \"world's first gene-edited babies\" Replay More Videos ...

And, frankly, there are simple proven ways to prevent the vast majority of HIV transmission events: safe sex and avoidance of contaminated needles.\n\nMost disturbing, CCR5 makes the children He has edited more prone to dying from the far more common influenza virus.\n\nIn a troubling twist, the Associated Press reports that American scientist Michael Deem, a professor of bioengineering at Rice University, appears to have participated in the work. Deem told the Associated Press he was in China when the study's participants consented and that they seemed aware of the risks involved. CNN reached out to Deem for comment, but he did not reply.\n\nAmerican research universities typically demand some level of oversight and awareness of their researchers' activities -- regardless of where in the world they are working. Rice University is now investigating Deem's alleged involvement. Rice's spokesperson told me in an email that \"this work as described in press reports, violates scientific conduct guidelines and is inconsistent with ethical norms of the scientific community and Rice University.\"\n\nAn American Institutional Review Board, the kind of local body of clinicians, scientists, ethicists, and community members responsible for ensuring human subjects research is sufficiently safe and balances interests of the patient and community, would not have approved this study.\n\nWhy? It's likely because China has a much more lax regulatory structure than in Europe or the United States, allowing relatively informal hospital ethics committees to approve novel genetic research. In Europe and the United States, multiple layers of national regulators provide checks and balance to highly formalized medical trials -- slowing the research process.\n\nBut this lax structure has gotten China into trouble before. In 2015, two of the world's top scientific journals, Nature and Science, both cited ethical objections in rejecting the first paper reporting on genetic editing of a human embryo -- work that took place in China. Protein and Cell, the journal that did publish the study, did so, it claimed , only to \"sound an alarm\" on the scientists who had carried out the study.\n\nIt is also dismaying to think an American research professor could have assisted in the project in any capacity.\n\nIn a YouTube video, He says that the birth of the world's first IVF child 40 years ago was greeted with a storm of controversy, but that the procedure is now routine, and he expects his announcement to be no different. In truth, there is no parallel. Fertilization of an egg outside the human body carries with it no change to the body of the subsequent child and has no impact on future generations.\n\nFor more opinion...

Officials did not estimate the precise impact of the deal Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated with the European Union , but even in the best case it too will mean a weaker economy than remaining in the bloc.\n\n\"It is true that the economy will be very slightly smaller, but if we do the deal in the way that the prime minister has set out and negotiated, that impact will be entirely manageable,\" UK Treasury chief Philip Hammond told the BBC.\n\nThe official estimates underscore the harsh economic reality of Brexit: Under any scenario, leaving the European Union will make Britain poorer than staying in.\n\nRead More\n\n\"If you look purely at the economics, remaining in the single market would give us an economic advantage,\" Hammond said. The Bank of England said that May's plan could result in new trade barriers that would cause the UK economy to be 0.75% smaller than currently forecast in 2023. If she can negotiate a future trade relationship with the European Union that does not include customs checks or regulatory barriers, the economy could be 1.75% larger. May defends Brexit deal as Trump casts doubt on UK ability to trade with US There are just four months to go until Brexit, and it's still not clear whether May can deliver an orderly departure from the bloc. The legally-binding divorce deal she has negotiated would give business much-needed certainty about the next two years. But she still needs to secure approval from a skeptical parliament, and a much looser agreement on the trading relationship after the transition period provides very few details. Analysis commissioned by a group campaigning for a second referendum showed the UK economy would be 4% smaller by 2030 under May's deal than it would otherwise have been. The National Institute for Economic and Social Research said on Monday that new trade barriers would make it difficult to sell services from the United Kingdom and discourage investment. Prime Minister Theresa May is trying to sell her Brexit plan to a skeptical parliament. If May's plan fails, potential alternatives include crashing out of the European Union without a deal, a second referendum or a general election in Britain. \"The important thing ... is to keep trade flowing as much as we can,\" Hammond told Sky News. Forecasts assume a US-UK trade deal May's plan includes a transition period during which most trading rules for companies will remain the same. It would also mean a close relationship with the European Union on trade in financial services, and broad cooperation on transportation and energy.

Crashing out of the European Union would sink the UK economy into recession, analysts have warned. 'No-deal' Brexit worse than 2008 The government said that leaving without a deal would result in the UK economy being 7.7% smaller 15 years after Brexit. That's compared to current trading arrangements, and assumes no change in immigration. The damage would be even greater if net migration from the European Union dropped to zero, the government said. Some key sectors of the economy would be especially hard hit by a messy Brexit. Official estimates show that the auto, chemicals and pharmaceutical industries, which trade heavily with the European Union, would be more than 20% smaller over the long run. The Bank of England warned in its report that a disorderly Brexit would cause the UK economy to contract by 8%. The value of the pound would slump by as much as 25% and home prices could plummet 30%. The economic fallout would be worse than Britain suffered because of the global financial crisis.

Between April 2017 and March 2018, almost 5,000 women and girls in the UK were newly identified as victims of FGM, according to the National Health Service. Figures of children identified as being at risk were not collected before 2016-2017, so annual rates can only be compared over the past two years. 'Tip of the iceberg' In September, FGM survivor and campaigner Leyla Hussein warned that some schoolgirls in the UK were being pressured into FGM by their peers. \"Whilst we are making progress in tackling FGM, these alarming statistics show it is still being practised in communities across England,\" said Leethen Bartholomew, head of the National FGM Centre, which is a joint initiative between the LGA and children's charity Barnardo's. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. \"Even more concerning is that these figures are likely to just be the tip of the iceberg because many cases of FGM go undetected,\" he added. The LGA called for greater funding for social care, in order to identify and protect children from the risk of FGM and other forms of abuse. \"To maximise the effectiveness of this prevention and intervention work, children's services departments need further funding to address the scale of demand for help from children and their families,\" said Lower, who is also a councillor for the center-left Liberal Democrat party. The UK government announced an extra \u00a3410 million ($523 million) for adult and children's social care in 2019-2020 in its recent budget, but the LGA said this \"doesn't go far enough to plug the \u00a33 billion ($3.8 billion) funding gap facing children's services by 2025.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/health/fgm-children-at-risk-figures-scli-gbr-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ross Edgley: How to swim 1792 miles in 157 days", "text": "(CNN) He had swum for 157 days around the entire coastline of Great Britain, but as Ross Edgley approached the finish of his epic adventure, he was energized by something \"special\" in the water.\n\nHe had battled extreme fatigue, cold, pain, jellyfish stings and parts of his tongue falling off during the 1,792-mile journey, but there to greet him on a freezing November morning were 300 swimmers to guide the weary traveler to the shore.\n\n\"When I think about it, I can't help but smile,\" he told CNN Sport. \"The best way I can describe it is goosebumps upon tears, upon smiles. Literally, you could feel something in the water. It sounds a bit spiritual but it was just amazing.\"\n\nEdgley had just become the first person to achieve the epic feat of endurance. Starting on the south coast of England, he was at sea for nearly 23 weeks without once stepping back on land. Come rain or shine, he swam twice a day in six-hour shifts, using lessons he learned while training with the Royal Marines. \"Focus on the process and the outcome is inevitable,\" said the Briton.\n\nMental resilience\n\nMany told him that he was mad to attempt it. The water was too cold and the tides too strong, they said. For Edgley, though, that was the exact motivation he needed. The 33-year-old thrives off the impossible and the desire to prove everyone wrong. \"I knew how to put one arm in front of the other,\" he joked. \"It's just the case of doing that until you got all around the coast.\" Meeting in London, Edgley somehow retained an impressive level of vigor just days after completing the mammoth challenge. He even had an infectious enthusiasm for his multiple media commitments, treating them as therapy for the hardship that he tried to block out over the summer. It was this positive attitude to life combined with a \"feral\" ability to keep putting his face back into the freezing cold water that made it possible.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ross Edgley swam around Great Britain in 157 days. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ross Edgley swam around Great Britain in 157 days. 02:25\n\nJust like his physical prowess, Edgley's mental resilience has been refined over the years. He graduated with a 1st class honors degree from Loughborough University School of Sport and Exercise Science and has continued his fascination with sports psychology ever since. The theories he learned enabled him to ignore the \"physiological hand-brake\" when his mind would tell his body to stop. \"I was in pieces but I thought, 'Are you actually completely fatigued, or is that you just trying to pull that physiological handbrake? Have you got any more?,'\" he said.\n\nAre you completely fatigued, or are you just trying to pull that physiological handbrake?\n\n'Eccentric explorer'\n\nUnsurprisingly, Edgley comes from an active family. His mother was a sprinter, his father a tennis coach, one grandfather a marathon runner and the other in the military. Sport was all they would talk about over dinner, and Edgley developed a fascination for fitness and mammoth tests of endurance. Before this swim, Edgley had climbed a rope to the height of Everest, run a marathon while pulling a car and completed a triathlon whilst carrying a 100-pound tree. Some of his motivation stems from a desire to emulate a previous British explorers.\n\nCaptain Matthew Webb, who in 1875 became the first man to swim across the English Channel, is a particular source of inspiration. Like Edgley and the Great British Swim, everyone told Captain Webb that swimming the Channel was impossible. \"There was something about that which was so amazing, so British,\" he said. \"This eccentric explorer, I loved it.\"\n\nEdgley was joined by 300 swimmers for the final mile of his epic around-Britain swim.\n\nThe darkest moments\n\nEdgley was accompanied on his odyssey by husband and wife duo Matt and Suzanne Knight. Their boat was the support vehicle where Edgley rested, ate and slept when not in the water. Swimming, as they all found out, was just a small part of the expedition.\n\nThe stories Edgley tells of extreme cold, sleep deprivation and wet-suit chaffing (so bad that his open wounds stuck to his bed sheets) instead defined his swim. There was one particular run-in with mother nature that really stood out. While navigating the Gulf of Corryvreckan in Scotland -- home to the third largest whirlpool in the world -- Edgley was hit in the face by a jellyfish. This was nothing new. Edgley was stung 37 times during the journey but this sting felt \"a little different,\" he said. \"It just didn't go away, it was searing into my skin.\"\n\nAfter hours of swimming through excruciating pain, Edgley identified the root of the problem. He found the tentacle, which had applied the first sting, threaded through his goggles. It had been slapping him in the face for hours, causing multiple stings to his left eye. \"The goggles wouldn't fit back on my face because my left eye was so swollen,\" Edgley laughed. \"I had to just punch the goggles into my face so that they no longer leaked and then I could carry on swimming.\"\n\nEdgley fashioned a makeshift anti-jellyfish mask.\n\nIt's just one of the nightmarish scenarios that Edgley could not prepare for. His training, nevertheless, was brutal. Having previously written \"The Word's Fittest Book,\" Edgley wanted to put his theories to the test. The hours spent in the gym, swimming pool and the open water were all informed by the multiple endurance events he'd previously completed. He developed the concept of work capacity -- which considered how much his body could take and still recover from. After pushing this boundary to its absolute limit, it became evident that the Great British Swim could, on paper, be possible. That small glimmer was enough.\n\nIt was as much an exploration of my digestive system as it was the British coastline.\n\nEdgley consumed up to 15,000 calories every day.\n\nEating with an eroded tongue\n\nFood was also a vital component of the mission. A diet plan had been carefully created prior to the start but it didn't last long. Instead, it was a diet of necessity. Edgley consumed between 10,000-15,000 calories a day to meet the energy requirements of his body. The method would often throw up some unlikely combinations, such as a feast of two-deep fried pizzas and a super-healthy green shake. \"I call it edible exploration, it's whatever works for me. It was as much an exploration of my digestive system as it was the British coastline,\" he said. There was also the surprising problem with palatability. After weeks of swimming 12 hours a day, Edgley developed salt-tongue which made eating certain foods \"taste like sandpaper.\" It's a condition caused by sea water which erodes the tissue and causes part of the tongue to fall off (it has since grown back). Bananas were sometimes the only thing Edgley could cope. He consumed a remarkable 649 bananas, recording each on the cabin roof.\n\nEdgley records each banana he eats on the cabin roof.\n\nGetting back on land, my feet are like, 'What are you doing? They are still struggling to figure out what's going on.\n\nHis physique has changed a lot since the start of the swim, when he had a body sculptured by hard work in the gym. He has added 10kg of \"seal blubber\" to his upper body, and is now learning to walk properly again after \"skipping leg day\" for almost half a year. A lack of walking has caused the arches of his feet to sink. \"Getting back on land, my feet are like, 'What are you doing? They are still struggling to figure out what's going on,'\" he said. The fitness expert is proud of his new physique, though, and hopes to encourage others to be \"instruments not ornaments,\" an indication of how he views an aesthetics-driven fitness industry.\n\nWhat next?\n\nDespite the obvious hardship, Edgley looks back positively on the experience and insists that he's not yet bored of swimming. \"The sunsets, swimming with minke whales and dolphins. For all of the hardship which is easy to talk about, there were so many privileges as well,\" he said. Edgley has promised his family some time off before embarking on his next challenge. \"If you can swim around Great Britain, where else can you swim to?\" he teased. \"I'll have my Christmas dinner and then maybe next year.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/sport/ross-edgley-great-british-swim-fitness-health-the-moment-spt-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "After 5 months at sea, Ross Edgley completes swim around Great Britain", "text": "(CNN) After spending 157 days at sea, a 33-year-old man came ashore Sunday and became the first person to swim around the mainland of Great Britain, according to Red Bull, the company that documented his feat.\n\nRoss Edgley started the 1,791-mile trek June 1 in Margate, a coastal town in southeast England.

Better yet, turn to a stranger on the street and ask them. Odds are good -- dollars to doughnuts -- their answer is different from yours.\n\nFrom childhood treats to a grandparent's favorite recipes, beloved foods are deeply personal. This seems especially true of desserts, which often take pride of place at celebrations and traditional holidays.\n\nFor all the nostalgia of sugary treats, though, some sweets rise above local flavors. Head to any country to find tender slices of Italian tiramis\u00fa at the bottom of cafe menus or sniff out the creamy scent of Hong Kong's dan tats in cities around the globe. In the unofficial elections of the stomach, both have been voted to a permanent place in the world's food hall of fame.\n\nAnd like dan tats, many of these recipes aren't desserts at all -- the eggy tart is more often eaten as an afternoon snack. The idea of serving a sweet at the end of a coursed meal is relatively recent, and in some places, including Africa and Asia, desserts are a foreign import.\n\nBut with food, like language or culture, determining what's \"foreign\" turns out to be complicated. Tiramisu relies on chocolate, coffee and sugar that arrived in Italy through global trade, while Hong Kong's most iconic sweet has roots in the Portuguese age of exploration.\n\nRelated content These beloved desserts preserve sugar's history\n\nLike the best desserts, then, this list blends the personal with something more broadly appealing. It's the fruit of my nine years in the pastry kitchen, when I traveled to explore new-to-me flavors everywhere from Liguria, Italy, to Yucatan, Mexico, and conversations with chefs whose resumes are as global as the recipes themselves.\n\nIn emails sent from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Syrian-Lebanese cookbook author Anissa Helou recalled favorite sweets that grace tables in Morocco, Iran and the Levant.\n\nIn alphabetical order, here's a list of some of the greatest sweets on the planet, from humble chocolate chip cookies to the crisp tang of kashata, a beloved brittle that's enjoyed across East Africa. Bon app\u00e9tit -- or as they'd say in Swahili, karibu chakula!\n\nAlfajores, South America\n\nShutterstock\n\nStep into a neighborhood bakery from Argentina to Peru, and you're likely to find these tender, filled cookies piled high behind the counter. The crumbly bite of shortbread gives way to a sweet layer of dulce de leche, a caramel-like candy made by gently cooking sweetened milk until it turns into a rich, mellow treat.\n\nThe very simplicity of the cookies has proved to be the perfect base for creative cooks across Latin America. Try versions that are dunked in dark chocolate, coated in a sweet layer of white chocolate, rolled in coconut and dressed up with spices, or opt for the classic -- it's among the world's most comforting snacks.\n\nApfelstrudel, Austria\n\nNatasha Breen/REDA&CO/UIG/Getty Images\n\nFor a floury lesson in gluten's architectural wonders, whip up a batch of traditional strudel dough. The real thing is stretched -- not rolled -- into an improbably thin sheet; according to legend, it should be transparent enough to read a newspaper through.\n\nOnce extended, the delicate dough is wrapped around a sweet, apple filling that's enriched with buttery fried breadcrumbs, raisins and sometimes walnuts. The delicious result can be found in pastry shops around the world, but for the classic experience, head to Vienna's Caf\u00e9 Korb for a slice followed by a lush cup of cream-topped Viennese coffee.\n\nBaklava, Turkey\n\nShutterstock\n\nDozens of delicate layers melt into a single tender bite in this syrupy confection, which is among the sweetest legacies of the Ottoman Empire. While it remains a sought-after treat through the Levant, Balkans, the Caucasus and North Africa -- regions that were once ruled from Constantinople -- the spiritual home of baklava is surely the modern-day country of Turkey.\n\nThere, pastry shops serve great trays sliced into diamonds, filled with ground nuts and dripping with honeyed syrup. This is just the most famous of the Ottoman Empire's syrup-soaked pastries, but it's snagged the limelight for good reason. With a simple list of ingredients and endless variations, it easily ranks among the world's most tempting treats.\n\nBlack Forest Cake, Germany\n\nShutterstock\n\nAlong with fairy tales and mountain-top castles, Germany's Black Forest region is known as the namesake -- if not the origin -- of the country's most luscious cake. Dark rounds of chocolate cake are doused in a cherry syrup spiked with kirschwasser, a sour cherry brandy, then stacked atop a thin, chocolate base with deep layers of whipped cream and fresh cherries.\n\nIf that wasn't flavor enough, the whole thing is swathed in more cream, dusted with shaved chocolate and studded with cherries. The resulting cake is a frothy dream dessert that's the star of pastry cases around Germany, where it's known as a Schwarzw\u00e4lder Kirschtorte.\n\nRelated content Best German bars around the world\n\nBorma, Middle East and Turkey\n\nShutterstock\n\nThreads of crisp, golden knafeh dough wrap around a rich nut filling in this sweet dessert, which is an elegant and aromatic relative of baklava. Unlike baklava, borma is often fried, adding an extra infusion of flavor and a crisp texture that stands up to a sugary bath in flavored syrup.\n\nAnd while baklava hides its filling inside a modest layer of filo dough, borma is rolled and sliced, showing off a cross-section of colorful pistachios, pale pine nuts or walnuts. That eye-catching presentation makes borma especially popular as a present. Pastry shops across the Middle East and Turkey tempt passers-by with piles of borma stacked high on enormous platters.\n\nBrownies, United States\n\nRobert Lachman/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nFudgy or cakey? Corner piece or slice from the middle? Aficionados of this beloved American sweet are sure to have a take on the best -- and worst -- way to make a brownie. One of the earliest recipes appeared in Fannie Farmer's 1906 \"Boston Cooking School Cook Book,\" using the unsweetened chocolate that lends brownies a fudgy texture.\n\nIn more than a century of brownie making, they've become a mainstay treat, the base for sundaes and a seriously addictive ice cream flavor.\n\nEven the actress Katharine Hepburn had an opinion on how to bake them, and an old story holds that the glamorous star once dispensed the following advice: \"Never quit, be yourself and don't put too much flour in your brownies.\"\n\nCannoli, Sicily\n\nShutterstock\n\nA shattering-crisp shell gives way to a creamy cheese filling in this Sicilian classic, whose roots reach deep into the island's diverse culinary history. With origins at the wild Carnival celebrations at Palermo, the traditional cannolo is filled with silky-smooth ricotta cheese made from sheep's milk.\n\nTaste that rich filling for evidence of the Arab influence that infuses Sicilian cuisine: The candied citrus that often flavors the creamy interior remains beloved throughout the Middle East.\n\nRelated content Going to Sicily? 10 things to know before your trip\n\nCardamom Buns, Sweden\n\nShutterstock\n\nOctober 4 might be Cinnamon Bun Day on the Swedish calendar, but many bun aficionados insist that the aromatic cardamom version outshines cinnamon's more assertive charms. One of a family of vetebullar, or wheat buns, cardamom buns are best enjoyed as a part of fika, the coffee break that comes twice daily in many Swedish workplaces.\n\nWhile a freshly baked cardamom bun is a memorable treat, it's also a simple and comforting one. In a classic recipe from author Johanna Kindvall , crushed cardamom seeds are stirred into lightly enriched, yeasted dough, then rolled up with a sweet layer of sugar and spice.\n\nFor the perfect fika, whip up a batch of cardamom buns, brew some strong coffee and call a friend, since the iconic Swedish coffee break is as much about talking as it is about treats.\n\nCendol, Singapore\n\nShutterstock\n\nOn sweltering afternoons in Singapore, locals cool off with this chilled and silky sweet, which is a favorite at seaside restaurants and sidewalk stands. Iced coconut milk is sweetened with a palm sugar syrup, which lends it a lightly smoky, caramelized flavor.\n\nThe rich liquid is a lush base for tender threads of green rice-flour jelly, which gets its vivid color from the pandan juice that's extracted from leaves of the tropical screw pine.\n\nVersions of this blissfully cool dessert can be found throughout southeast Asia, but with the addition of a scoop of sweetened red beans, Singapore's take on the classic treat remains especially tempting.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookies, United States\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe quintessential American treat is deceptively simple: a basic, creamed-butter cookie recipe turns out to have endless subtle variations that produc dramatically different results.\n\nWhatever your favorite version, a perfect chocolate chip cookie is a delicate balance of textures and flavors. A crispy rim gives way to a tender, melting center, and the buttery sweetness of the dough sets off the slight edge of bittersweet chocolate and brown sugar.\n\nLegend has it that the chocolate chip cookie has its origins in a happy accident, when Massachusetts inn owner Ruth Wakefield stirred chopped chocolate into her cookie dough in an attempt to make uniformly chocolatey cookies. Her brand-new recipe was published in a Boston newspaper, and the rest was pastry history.\n\nChocolate Mousse, France\n\nShutterstock\n\nAn airy confection made with just a handful of ingredients, chocolate mousse is a delicious paradox: the richer it is, the lighter it seems. Gallic chefs have been whipping up chocolate mousse -- the word means \"foam\" in French -- for at least a few hundred years, but the quest for foamy chocolate is much older.\n\nAmong the Olmec, Maya and Aztec peoples who consumed chocolate long before contact with Europeans, a hefty layer of foam was considered the height of good taste, and ancient codices depict cooks pouring chocolate from several feet in the air to create a froth.\n\nCoconut Cake, Southern United States\n\nShutterstock\n\nBouncy, buttery rounds of vanilla cake are piled high with shredded coconut and seven-minute frosting for a classic Southern dessert. This is the kind of all-American sweet that stars at potlucks, cake walks and church picnics, and it's often made with recipes passed down on hand-written recipe cards.\n\nThere are dozens of versions, but every single one is cloaked in a frothy layer of shredded coconut ... preferably fresh.\n\nLayer cakes weren't invented in the United States, but the distinctive profile of the coconut cake is pure Americana, and there's no mistaking the high, round shape of an American layer cake for a slim European torte.\n\nDespite the minimalist, all-white color scheme, the coconut cake is an over-the-top, old-fashioned pleasure. The tooth-achingly sweet meringue frosting is a throwback that's rarely seen outside of the South, and it's worth making the original version for a taste of a unique American tradition.\n\nRelated content Blending culinary traditions across the US South\n\nCornes de Gazelle, Morocco\n\nShutterstock\n\nEven in a crowded field of tempting Moroccan sweets, these filled pastries are perennial favorites, and the labor-intensive dessert appears at celebrations and special meals throughout the year.\n\nIn the classic version, a thin layer of dough curves around a filling of ground almonds scented with orange blossom water. Since cornes de gazelle are baked just until they're lightly golden, the dough retains a tender texture that melts into the center.\n\nWhile cornes de gazelle are prepared across Morocco -- as well as in the nearby countries of Tunisia and Algeria -- the most visually elaborate versions come from the Moroccan port city of Tetouan, where bakers use intricate molds to create patterns in the dough before baking.\n\nCr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, France\n\nDavid Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/TNS/Getty Images\n\nShiny, burnt sugar tops this creamy dessert, and the perfect cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is a study in contrasts. Each bite should blend a bit of crispy caramel -- burned just to the very edge of bitterness -- with the aromatic flavor of vanilla custard.\n\nOften made using pure cream, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is among the richest of all the custard desserts, and it must be gently cooked in a water bath to prevent curdling and overbaking.\n\nFor pastry chefs, part of the appeal of preparing cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is the fiery drama of burning the sugar topping. They execute the job with everything from a blow torch to a traditional salamander, a cast-iron disk that can be heated to blazing temperatures and is said to produce the most even results.\n\nDan Tats, Hong Kong\n\nShutterstock\n\nFollow the wafting scent of egg custard into a Hong Kong bakery to sample one of the territory's most iconic treats. Perfectly sized for eating out-of-hand, dan tats are best enjoyed fresh from the oven, when the warm custard meets a perfectly crisp crust. And with a map-spanning backstory, dan tats are among the tastiest symbols of globalization.\n\nMany trace dan tats to the similar past\u00e9is de nata of Portugal; those eggy tarts traveled with Portuguese traders and colonists to cities around the world. After establishing a foothold in Hong Kong via nearby Macau, they were re-exported to Chinatowns around the globe, where they tempt passersby from steaming pastry cases and shop windows.\n\nRelated content 17 beautiful places to see in Hong Kong\n\nDoughnuts, United States\n\nShutterstock\n\nIn the Pantheon of world desserts, fried dough is a mainstay. Everything from French beignets to Greek loukoumades are doughnuts of a kind, and it's no wonder they're so beloved; a quick swim in boiling oil transforms simple bread dough into a fast and filling treat. But it's latter day American doughnuts that earn a place on this list for their creative approach to fillings and flavors.\n\nFrom Portland, Maine's The Holy Donut to Voodoo Doughnut in Portland, Oregon, the old-school doughnut has been loaded down under piles of maple frosting, crispy bacon, fresh fruit glazes and boozy toppings that take the sweet into uncharted territory\n\nEszterhazy Torta, Hungary\n\nShutterstock\n\nIn its glory days, the Austro-Hungarian empire stretched across central Europe, and a century after the empire fell its creamy legacy can still be found in pastry shop windows from Vienna to Sarajevo.\n\nFor this elegant cake, slim rounds of almond meringue are piled high between stripes of chocolate buttercream, then topped with a marbled spiderweb of chocolate and vanilla fondant.\n\nA melting texture and rich sweetness make this old-fashioned cake a perennial favorite in sweets-loving Budapest, but it's just as easy to find in Vienna, the grand city that once led the empire. It remains deeply influenced by a shared culinary tradition.\n\nFlan, Latin America\n\nBob Fila/Chicago Tribune/MCT/Getty Images\n\nIn the sprawling family tree of custard desserts, Latin America's flan is the coolest cousin, blending perfect simplicity with creamy sophistication.\n\nA whisper-thin layer of dark caramel tops the dessert, melting into syrupy sauce around the base. Flan might have arrived in Latin America from Spain, but it's since been claimed and reinvented by generations of cooks here.\n\nIn Mexico, where the dessert is served everywhere from neighborhood cafes to family celebrations, the silky texture of a classic flan is the perfect foil for a meal with fiery chiles and aromatic spices.\n\nG\u00e2teau Fondant au Chocolat, France\n\nShutterstock\n\nCut into a warm round of g\u00e2teau fondant au chocolat -- that means \"melting chocolate cake\" in French -- to release the slow flood of chocolate from the interior.\n\nThis dark and rich cake is a high-wire act of time and temperature: Serve too early and it's a sticky pool of hot cake batter; serve too late and it's a brownie. When the balance is perfect, however, the treat blends the tender bite of a chocolate cake with the oozy pleasure of a melted chocolate bar.\n\nIn the 1990s, the cake became a menu star as a lava cake or molten chocolate cake. While the heat of the craze has passed, this sensuous dessert remains one of the world's most sophisticated ways to end a meal.\n\nGelato, Italy\n\nShutterstock\n\nFrom shaved ice to sorbet, frozen desserts are melting evidence of one of the world's great food truths: there's nothing so welcome as a cold, sugary treat on a summer afternoon.\n\nOn the global heat map of frozen desserts, though, gelato's sweet innovations earn top honors. Lower fat content and a warmer serving temperature help flavors shine brighter than in ice cream, whether you're savoring a sunny scoop of lemon gelato, a rich hazelnut version or classic chocolate.\n\nIn Italy, the year-round treat in an essential food experience, and true aficionados even make the pilgrimage to the Gelato Museum in Bologna , where tours include a guided tasting at the museum cafe.\n\nRelated content 500 food experiences worth traveling for\n\nGulab Jamun, India\n\nShutterstock\n\nA lush, syrupy distillation of milky flavor, these deep-fried Indian treats are anything but a simple doughnut.\n\nTraditional recipes for gulab jamun dough start with a scoop of khoya, a reduction of cow or buffalo milk that simmers for hours over a low flame, lending the finished product a melting texture.\n\nFrying gulab jamun in ghee provides a second injection of fatty flavor before the dumplings are soaked in an aromatic syrup infused with cardamom seeds and roses.\n\nThe rich and labor-intensive sweet is a favorite at Indian celebrations from Eid al-Fitr to Diwali, but the name points to origins in Persia -- legend has it that gulab jamun arrived in medieval India with Persian troops.\n\nJapanese Cheesecake\n\nShutterstock\n\nFor the cheesecake aficionado who finds the New York version a trifle heavy, this Japanese treat might be a revelation. In the creamy sweet, which blends the flavorful tang of cheesecake with the loft of a sponge cake, the richness of lightly cultured cheese is offset by a light and airy texture.\n\nThe secret is an unusual technique of blending beaten egg whites -- a meringue -- into a warm batter that is rich with cream cheese and vanilla. Versions of this cheesecake are available everywhere from Japanese convenience stores to top-shelf bakeries.\n\nWhen making your own or shopping for the perfect slice, watch for a characteristic jiggle that hints at the light, tender texture to come.\n\nKashata, East Africa\n\nSohadiszno/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nWander through a market in East Africa to find this golden sweet, which blends the satisfying crunch of caramelized sugar with the rich heft of peanuts, fresh coconut or a blend of the two.\n\nBridging the delicious divide between cookie and confection, kashata gets an aromatic boost from the addition of cardamom, which elevates the brittle-like treat into the realms of world-class sweets.\n\nThe traders who once plied the coast of East Africa in dhow sailboats brought new words, flavors and spices from across the water, and the name of this beloved treat is adapted from Arabic -- but for many, kashata is among the sweetest and most nostalgic flavors of East Africa.\n\nKifli, Hungary\n\nShutterstock\n\nWhile the rest ofthe world eats jam, central Europe enjoys the rich flavor of lekv\u00e1r, a chunky preserve that retains all the tartness of the region's ripe apricots and plums. The hearty fruit preserve is the delicious prize inside these crescent pastries.\n\nA soft, flaky dough is shaped into a plump half-moon that barely contains the sweet filling, then topped with a light blanket of powdered sugar. Not that kifli are limited to fruit preserves. The sweets, which are especially beloved at holiday times, are often stuffed with sweetened walnuts or poppy seeds.\n\nKnafeh, Levant\n\nShutterstock\n\nGolden pastry tops sweet cream, nuts or salty cheese in this syrupy dessert, which offers a satisfying contrast of texture and flavor. Like many Middle Eastern desserts, knafeh is soaked in an aromatic sugar syrup that infuses the pastry topping and filling with the flavor of roses or orange blossoms.\n\nWhile crowds line up for sweet slices of knafeh from Amman to Alexandria, the most iconic place to try the dessert might be in the Palestinian city of Nablus, which claims the title of knafeh's home town.\n\nIn the Nablus version, a tangy filling of goat cheese is covered by threads of fine pastry or a tender blanket of baked semolina. Some knafeh-loving locals even layer the local sweet with a pair of pita rounds for a memorable sandwich.\n\nKouign Amann, Brittany, France\n\nShutterstock\n\nOnce a little-known treat that drew pastry pilgrims to Brittany, the kouign amann has officially made it big. Celebrity pastry chef Dominique Ansel gave it a boost by serving the caramel-crusted rounds in his SoHo bakery, but it's the kouign amann's sheer perfection that sent it down the sticky road to fame.\n\nBrittany is known for the high quality of its butter and sea salt, and kouign amann simply means \"butter cake\" in the Breton language. It earns the name. Like a croissant, the kouign amann is rolled and folded with layers of butter, but fewer folds mean the kouign amann has a toothier, more rustic texture than its sophisticated city cousin.\n\nA roll in sugar, a sprinkle of Breton sea salt and one of the world's great pastries was born.\n\nRelated content San Francisco baker's take on kouign amann\n\nKulfi, India\n\nShutterstock\n\nAmong the most voluptuous treats in the ice cream family, this frozen dessert has a temptingly rich texture. Traditional recipes, which can require hours of constant stirring, start by simmering fresh milk over a low flame, a slow reduction that lends a caramel sweetness to the milk's natural sugars.\n\nWhile modern-day kulfi appears in dozens of flavors, classic versions are infused with some of India's most lilting tastes.\n\nIn cities across the country, visit a kulfiwallah for a transporting sample of rose, cardamom, saffron or pistachio kulfi; while recipes change with time, the sweet treat you're tasting is thought to have roots in the Mughal Empire.\n\nLemon Tart, France\n\nShutterstock\n\nA slender layer of lemon cream fills this classic French tart, whose flavor balances rich butter, the acidity of lemon juice and the bite of lemon zest. The crust, with a texture that's similar to a shortbread cookie, retains a fatty crunch that's an ideal contrast to the silky filling.\n\nWhen perfectly executed the result is dessert heaven, and the simplicity of the tart makes it a fitting icon of the French pastry kitchen. While the old-fashioned version remains a beloved stand-by, some of the best tarts in Paris offer intriguing twists: try Sadaharu Aoki's yuzu tart, made with an aromatic relative of the lemon, or head to Pierre Herm\u00e9 to taste an extra lemony version topped by bits of candied citrus.\n\nLinzer Torte, Austria\n\nShutterstock\n\nLike its namesake city in Austria, this slender torte is an old-fashioned favorite that's still a star in the 21st century. A dough enriched with ground nuts, often hazelnuts or walnuts, melts into a jammy filling for a treat that's somewhere between cake and tart.\n\nRecipes for Linzer tortes have been around since at least 1653, and in the torte's Linz homeland, families pass variations on the richly spiced confection from generation to generation.\n\nAlong with the peek-a-boo lattice crust that hints at the filling at the heart of the torte, spices lend this tender sweet its lasting charm. While the filling is often a simple fruit preserve, Linzer torte dough is aromatic with ground cloves, cinnamon and lemon zest that make the Austrian treat a perennial favorite.\n\nM'hanncha, Morocco\n\nShutterstock\n\nCut into this golden spiral of pastry to uncover a rich filling of ground nuts, orange blossom water and mastic, a natural resin that perfumes sweets from Tangier to Turkey. Paired with a traditional glass of Moroccan mint tea, it's a generous and celebratory dessert that invites every guest to serve themselves as much as they'd like, scattering the slivered nuts and ground cinnamon that decorate the top.\n\nEven thinner than filo, the delicate warqa dough that's used for this Moroccan sweet is prepared by daubing a ball of dough on a hot griddle; it's an impressive labor of love that takes deft hands and many hours of practice.\n\nRelated content 25 of Africa's most amazing places to visit\n\nMa'amoul, Middle East\n\nShutterstock\n\nWhen celebrating some of the year's most anticipated holidays, many in the Levant reach for the comforting taste of these filled cookies, whose thin, semolina crust wraps around a delicious blend of chopped dates, nuts or both.\n\nThe simple cookies are shaped in wooden molds carved with intricate patterns, emerging as finely-wrought rounds or detailed cones.\n\nThey're a memorable treat with an appealingly mild sweetness, and a love of ma'amoul unites the region's three predominant religious traditions: Jews enjoy ma'amoul as a Purim treat, bakers shape vast piles of the sweets for Easter, and in some areas, ma'amoul are an essential part of Eid feasts.\n\nBite into one of these traditional sweets and you'll find out why.\n\nMandazi, South Sudan\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe addition of coconut milk lends a tender bite and subtle aroma to these satisfying fritters, whose light sweetness is especially appealing when paired with a cup of milky coffee or chai tea.\n\nIn some versions, a pinch of ground cardamom provides an extra jolt of spice, and the simple doughnuts are an invitation to get creative with flavors, toppings and sides.\n\nWhile many mandazi lovers trace the origins of these fried treats to South Sudan -- where they're often served with a rich chocolate dipping sauce that lands them firmly in dessert territory -- mandazi are also a beloved snack across Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda.\n\nMedovik, Russia\n\nShutterstock\n\nA touch of honey infuses an aromatic lilt into the slender layers of this cake, which is among Russia's most beloved treats. In between the cake layers, which can be stacked 10 high in the most elaborate versions, is a creamy frosting that melts into the honeyed rounds.\n\nVariations on medovik differ widely, but the most popular takes incorporate one of two very Russian ingredients into the sweet filling.\n\nSome use the rich sour cream that adds flavor to some of Russia's most comforting foods, from borscht to blini. Others get their flavor from sweetened condensed milk, which became an icon of Russian cooking during the Soviet era, when fresh milk could be hard to come by.\n\nNew York Cheesecake, United States\n\nNathan Congleton/NBC/Getty Images\n\nThe Big Apple's most iconic dessert seems to defy pastry physics. A light crumb offsets rich creaminess, a winning combination that elevates a simple list of flavors.\n\nLike the city itself, New York cheesecake draws inspiration from around the globe, and a genetic map of the cheese cake world would likely include the crumbly, dry-curd cheesecakes of eastern Europe, German kasekuchen and the fresh-cheese versions that are beloved in Italy.\n\nUnlike more fanciful recipes, New York's classic take on cheesecake eschews toppings or pronounced flavors, with just a hint of vanilla extract or lemon zest to lend a lilting aroma to a blend of sugar, eggs, cream and cream cheese, almost always Philadelphia brand. The brand is so associated with American cheesecakes that it's often called out by name on menus around the globe, where tarta de queso Philadelphia or g\u00e2teau fromage Philadelphia are rich diplomats for a beloved New York sweet.\n\nOliebollen, Netherlands\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe Netherlands' sweet contribution to the world of fried dumplings, oliebollen are a deliciously Dutch way to celebrate New Year's Eve. A crunchy, crispy ball of sweetened batter studded with raisins or currants, then dunked in powdered sugar, oliebollen are best eaten hot from street stands called oliebollenkrams.\n\nIt might seem like a simple snack, but oliebollen are serious business in the Netherlands, where an annual contest uses blind testing at the academic Center for Taste Research in Wageningen to choose the country's very best oliebol.\n\nPavlova, Australia and New Zealand\n\nShutterstock\n\nPastry-loving Aussies and Kiwis get riled when dinner conversations turn to Pavlova, a wonderfully messy meringue dessert that's a long-running sore point between Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAnna Pavlova, the globe-trotting Russian ballerina that the dessert is named for, visited both countries. Each claims the sweet as their own, but that's where the dispute ends -- no one denies the crunchy, creamy pleasures of a perfectly made Pavlova.\n\nSink a fork into the crisp meringue shell, and you'll discover a sweetly chewy interior. Piled high atop the meringue are fluffy whipped cream and tart fruits, a lofty topping whose richness and bright flavor offset the sugary base for a world-class dessert.\n\nRelated content For World Baking Day, take the Pavlova challenge\n\nPolvor\u00f3nes, Latin America, Spain and the Philippines\n\nShutterstock\n\nTiny, powdered cookies that crumble at the lightest touch, these shortbread treats are beloved from Manila to Mexico City. In the United States, a version of these cookies is often called Mexican wedding cookies, but it would be a shame to leave them for special occasions alone. Polvor\u00f3nes are the kind of simple treat that's welcome as an afternoon snack or piled onto a dessert tray, where they can hold their own against the world's greatest cookies.\n\nRecipes vary, and include almonds, walnuts or pecans, but each iteration of the cookies shares the same tender bite and origins in Spain; some speculate that the treats have even older roots in the Middle East.\n\nQatayef, Middle East\n\nShutterstock\n\nAs if hours of fasting weren't enough to pique the appetite, many Ramadan adherents can look forward to the sweet taste of qatayef when the sun finally does set.\n\nThe dessert starts life as a kind of yeasted pancake batter, but qatayef is griddled on just one side, creating a toothy balance between the golden-fried crust and tender interior. Stuffed into the folded base is a sweet mixture of fresh cheese, dried fruits, nuts or cream, often scented with rose water or ground cinnamon.\n\nSome versions of qatayef can be eaten just like that -- perhaps with the addition of some aromatic syrup -- but classic recipes are fried before serving, adding an additional layer of crunch and flavor before the beloved sweets hit the holiday table.\n\nRig\u00f3 Jancsi, Hungary\n\nShutterstock\n\nFluffy chocolate sponge cake is sandwiched with apricot jam and airy chocolate mousse in this classic treat. Topped with a whisper-thin layer of chocolate glaze then cut into tidy cubes of chocolate, the Rig\u00f3 Jancsi stands out even in the notably crowded field of fabulous Hungarian desserts.\n\nBeloved for a silky texture and rich flavor, the seductive cake was named for a love story that caught the world's attention with racy images and juicy details. Rig\u00f3 Jancsi was a Romani violinist who won the heart of the (married) Princesse de Caraman-Chimay of Belgium, and the two made international headlines when they ran off together in 1896.\n\nSaffron Ice Cream, Iran\n\nDeAgostini/Getty Images\n\nScented with saffron, rosewater and pistachios, it's no wonder that this Iranian ice cream is a favorite at Nowruz, the Persian New Year.\n\nFrom a lightly golden color to its distinctive aroma, the creamy treat is the essence of spring. Saffron ice cream, or bastani, is a memorable experience on its own, and its flavor alone easily snags a spot among the world's greatest frozen desserts.\n\nFor the complete bastani experience, though, opt for a traditional Iranian ice cream sandwich of saffron ice cream between two thin wafers. The wafers' mild flavor and crispy texture are the perfect foil -- and conveniently shaped handle -- for the rich and aromatic ice cream, which is beloved from Tehran to Tehrangeles.\n\nSesame Balls, Jian Dui, China\n\nShutterstock\n\nBite into the crisp shell of a deep-fried jian dui to discover a sweet filling within the golden, sesame-seed-studded exterior. This traditional Chinese treat is often filled with a sweet bean paste or a soft puree made from lotus seeds; both versions offer a deliciously mild counterpoint to the crunchy seeds.\n\nJian dui are especially popular as a treat at Lunar New Year celebrations, but not just for their delicious flavor. Dessert blogger and author Anita Chu writes that for many Chinese people, jian dui offer a special symbolism during that time: both the spherical shape and golden color are good omens for the year to come, as is the way the jian dui puff up when fried in hot oil.\n\nRelated content 10 of China's spiciest dishes\n\nSnow Ice, Xue Hua Bing, Taiwan\n\nShutterstock\n\nLike snow cones, Hawaiian shaved ice, raspados, granitas and dozens of other local variants, snow ice is Taiwan's answer to one of the world's great food truths: Nothing beats a sweet, icy treat when the weather is steamy.\n\nUnusual shaving technique and complex toppings elevate the Taiwanese version above the competition. A creamy base, which can be flavored with everything from green tea to fruit pur\u00e9es, is frozen solid then shaved into a lofty pile of crumbling ice flakes.\n\nTo top it all off, blend your own perfect mix of treats. Favorites include adzuki red bean paste, taro, grass jelly, fresh fruit, sweetened condensed milk and mochi, but Taiwanese snow ice is an invitation to get as creative as you'd like.\n\nSnow ice has spread to cities across the globe in recent years, but for the classic experience, head to Taipei's Shilin Night Market, where locals line up for the xue hua bing sold by dozens of vendors.\n\nSour Cherry Pie, Midwestern United States\n\nShutterstock\n\nSlice into the crispy top of a sour cherry pie, and the brilliant filling might come as a shock -- it's an electric color that seems more likely to be harvested from a can than a tree. That electric red comes from the tart Montmorency cherries that are the classic filling for this pie. Since the tender fruits are more perishable than their sweeter cousins, if you live outside the Midwest or Northeast United States you might never have seen one.\n\nSour cherries have plenty of acid to counter-balance the sugar in the filling, and they're rich in tannins, too. It's a hint of complexity that put this fruit pie over the top as one of the best in America.\n\nOn the search for the perfect slice of sour cherry pie? Head to the National Cherry Festival in Traverse City, Michigan, or to Jacksonport, Wisconsin's Cherry Fest\n\nSticky Rice with Mango, Thailand\n\nShutterstock\n\nIgnore the chalky versions sold in restaurants that are 10 time zones from a mango tree; a ripe, tender dish of sticky rice with mango is among the world's most perfect desserts. This traditional sweet begins with the glutinous rice that's grown in paddies across southeast Asia, and the starchy grains combine with rich coconut milk and palm sugar for a treat that retains a chewy bite even when it's perfectly soft.\n\nThe sweet world of mangoes includes hundreds and hundreds of cultivars, but for a truly Thai sticky rice with mango there are just two favored varieties: choose between nam dok mai, a sweet, yellow fruit that's pertly curvaceous, or aok rong, whose higher acidity offers a pleasant counterpoint to the sweet rice.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding, United Kingdom\n\nShutterstock\n\nThe ultimate in comforting British desserts, this homey sweet is a warm serving of sticky nostalgia. A base of soft cake is studded with chopped dates, then drowned in a creamy sauce. Much of the distinctive flavor comes from treacle, or molasses.\n\nWhile treacle has given way to crystallized sugar in most cooks' pantries, it was once a favored sweetener that was an important part of working-class diets in the UK. It's worth noting that sticky toffee pudding is not what's known as a pudding outside of the British Isles, where \"pudding\" is a generic term for dessert, but it's proved a popular export.\n\nWith versions served from Wales to Wellington, it's likely that the sun never sets on the world's sticky toffee puddings.\n\nTarte Tatin, France\n\nShutterstock\n\nIf you've never encountered this famed French dessert, then tarte Tatin may arrive as a delicious surprise. A world away from the architectural, lacquered creations that fill Parisian pastry shop windows, the very best of these are a humble mess with heavenly flavor -- preferably topped with a generous dollop of tangy cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. To bake this caramelized treat, start by layering apples, sugar and butter in a heavy pan, then top it off with a round of dough. The pastry seals the filling into a steamy enclosure, allowing the sugar to caramelize as the apples melt into tender perfection. The crux of the operation is when the tart emerges from the oven and must be flipped onto a plate before the molten sugar turns to sticky glue.\n\nTiramis\u00fa, Italy\n\nShutterstock\n\nCreamy layers of whipped mascarpone cradle coffee-soaked ladyfingers in this modern Italian dessert, which has become a sweet mainstay around the globe. It's no wonder. With a name that translates to \"pick me up,\" it's a combination of coffee, chocolate, cream and optional booze that's sure to pique even the most jaded palates.\n\nMost pastry-loving historians trace the treat's origins to the Treviso restaurant Le Beccherie, but by the time the world reached peak tiramis\u00fa in the late 1980s and 1990s, rival claims were hot as a strong-brewed cup of Italian espresso. Whatever the truth behind the creamy dessert, it's earned well-deserved pride of place on menus from Umbria to Ulaanbaatar.\n\nTres Leches Cake, Mexico and Central America\n\nShutterstock\n\nA fluffy sponge cake is the perfect vehicle for delivering loads of flavor in this wonderfully creamy dessert. The \"three milks\" that the sweet is named for are usually sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk and cream, which combine for a delightful cake so wet it's almost a drink.\n\nWhile fresh milk is now widely available, the flavor of sweetened condensed milk is a throwback to a time when the perishable stuff was hard to find, especially in warmer climates.\n\nEven in the days of refrigerated trucks, the gooey, sweet milk retains an appeal all its own, and flavor that infuses beloved treats around the world: it's stirred into Thai iced tea, drizzled over shaved ice raspados in Latin America and cooked into Brazilian brigadeiros.\n\nTrifle, United Kingdom\n\nShutterstock\n\nTender layers of sherry-soaked sponge cake alternate with jam, custard and -- in a practical British twist -- almost anything sweet and delicious the baker has on hand, as long as it's topped with a lush blanket of whipped cream. And no matter what you tuck between the rounds of cake, a trifle has a sweetly old-fashioned feel.\n\nThe name dates back to at least the 16th century and is probably older, though the ingredients of the dessert have evolved over time. Even as the equally-historic syllabub has disappeared from the standard playlist of homemade British desserts, trifle remains pure, creamy nostalgia for many food lovers.\n\nThe secret to the longevity of the trifle might be in its forgiving nature. When I was an apprentice baker in an Oakland caf\u00e9, a pastry chef offered me this reassuring advice: As long as your flavors are good, she said, don't worry too much about cakes emerging from the oven looking flawless. The worst-case scenario? \"Put it in a bowl and call it a trifle.\"\n\nTub Tim Krob, Thailand\n\nShutterstock\n\nWith a name that translates to \"crispy rubies,\" it's not hard to love this colorful and refreshing Thai dessert. After a fiery meal of Thai cuisine, tub tim krob cools with crushed ice and a sweetened coconut liquid infused with pandan leaves.\n\nWhile often compared with vanilla, pandan has a lilting aroma all its own, but for tub tim krob lovers the \"rubies\" are the real treasure. For these, water chestnuts are soaked in vivid grenadine syrup, rolled in tapioca flour, then boiled.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/world-50-best-desserts/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T11:03:49+00:00"}, {"title": "8 best luxury hotels in London according to LTI", "text": "Editor's Note \u2014 Editor's Note \u2014 LTI is a global members-only luxury travel ratings organization for the discerning traveler.

The Goring\n\nSince first opening in 1910, London's oldest family-owned hotel has been run by four members of the Goring dynasty.\n\nThe heritage interiors have been given a fresh and contemporary facelift with the help of some of current owner Jeremy Goring's famous designer friends -- David Linley, Nina Campbell, Tim Gosling and Russell Sage.\n\nThe reception desks evoke grand Georgian furniture, golden Gainsborough silk adorns the windows and hand-painted silver-leaf wallpaper by Fromental covers the walls. The result is sophisticated yet still reminiscent of an English country house.\n\nThe hotel's world-class hospitality has been recognized frequently and it was granted a Royal Warrant of appointment to Queen Elizabeth for hospitality service in 2013.\n\nThe rooms are smaller than many of London's top hotels, and it does not have a swanky spa, but this quality establishment does have wonderful interiors, quintessentially British elegance, excellent food, top-notch service and the second-largest privately owned garden in London (after Buckingham Palace).\n\nThere are 12 interconnecting rooms, which are ideal for families, and children are given a \"For Kids' Eyes Only\" welcome pack, with crayons, coloring books and a Goring Passport.\n\nThe Goring , 15 Beeston Pl, Westminster, London SW1W 0JW; +44 20 7396 9000\n\nThe Beaumont\n\nThe Beaumont was named the \"world's best luxury hotel\" by LTI in 2014. The Beaumont Hotel\n\nThis 1926 building, formerly a parking garage, has been transformed into one of London's hottest hotels.\n\nLTI named it the \"world's best luxury hotel\" in 2014 and Beaumont continues to impress.\n\nCreated by restaurateurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King (their first hotel after a string of popular restaurants), it's a symphony of 1920s chic, classic style and comfort.\n\nThe masculine interiors of this heritage protected building are supposedly \"stripped-back neo-classical,\" but the grand Art Deco interiors have a real sense of drama, still reflecting the building's history and a bygone era. We also love its quiet yet central Mayfair location.\n\nThe Beaumont holds a number of adjoining rooms, which are ideal for families, and babysitting is available on request.\n\nIts art collection, personal service, elegant rooms and hot restaurant make it a firm favorite on our London list.\n\nThere's also an impressive 2.5 staff to every one person and a 24-hour concierge to make sure guests needs are met around the clock.\n\nThe Beaumont , 8 Balderton St, Brown Hart Gardens, Mayfair, London W1K 6TF; +44 20 7499 1001\n\nBulgari\n\nGlamorous and sophisticated -- the Bulgari Hotel in London. Bulgari Hotel and Residences\n\nThe grandeur of Bulgari Hotel reflects the heritage and splendor of the renowned Italian jeweler and silversmith.\n\nJust moments from Hyde Park, this property in glamorous Knightsbridge has some of the largest accommodations in the capital.\n\nIt's super-chic, very modern (the building was built from scratch) and huge, with six floors below and nine above ground.\n\nIt feels big, but there are only 85 rooms and suites spread over six floors, indicating just how spacious they are.\n\nDesigned by Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel and Partners, the interiors are contemporary and yet still reflect London; for example, Portland stone and bronze has been used for the meticulous fa\u00e7ade and doors.\n\nIt has many child-friendly interconnecting rooms and plenty to keep the kids busy: a swimming pool, a cinema, PlayStations, Xbox and lots of games. The concierge or your butler can also arrange days out, babysitting and anything else needed.\n\nOther amenities include the Bulgari spa, which is spread over two stories, deep underground and offers a breadth of beauty, health and spa treatments.\n\nHotel bar Il Bar serves a host of cocktails and champagnes from a striking steel oval bar.\n\nBulgari , 171 Knightsbridge, London SW7 1DW; + 44 20 7151 1010\n\nCorinthia\n\nCorinthia's penthouses are based on characters found in London like The Whitehall, which has a giant, chess set on its roof terrace. Corinthia Hotel\n\nThis splendid 1885 building was renovated and transformed into a 21st century grand hotel by Corinthia Hotels.\n\nToday it feels modern and unrestrainedly lavish, but elements of the grand Victorian building are still evident, particularly in the public rooms and restaurants.\n\nThe hotel's rooms and suites are spacious and simple yet stylish; and its seven penthouses (based on characters found in London, such as The Royal, The Musician or The Actor) are magnificent.\n\nAs well as having some top-level restaurants and bars, the hotel is also home to ESPA Life, London's largest spa.\n\nThere's an in-house florist called By Appointment Only and a Harrods concession, while guests staying in a penthouse receive a complimentary chauffeur-driven car service.\n\nThe hotel's main bar, Bassoon, is a theatrical, atmospheric drinking den with a Roland grand piano that blends into an 11-meter bar lined with jazz-inspired art.\n\nCorinthia , Whitehall Pl, Westminster, London SW1A 2BD; +44 20 7930 8181\n\nClaridge's\n\nClaridge's provides a classically English experience. Claridge's\n\nWith its stunning design, elegance and perfect location, Claridge's is in a class of its own.\n\nIt offers a broad range of beautiful rooms and suites, mostly created by well-known designers, such as David Linley, Guy Oliver and Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nEach room is unique -- some Art Deco, some quirky and some traditional -- and all are equipped with state-of-the-art technology.\n\nThe splendid interiors reflect its heritage, while embracing the bold lines and curves of the 1920s.\n\nIts public spaces are equally spectacular: the lobby, two excellent restaurants and two stylish bars are steeped in history, but have been given a modern facelift.\n\nThe grand Entrance Hall epitomizes the history of Claridge's, with gilded mirrors, crystal chandeliers, elegant archways and columns, black and white chessboard floors and rich-hued leather furniture.\n\nFamilies are very welcome at Claridge's and there's even a designated children's concierge.\n\nLike the adults, children can request their favorite magazine and are given tote goody bags on arrival and mini-bathrobes at bedtime.\n\nTop quality service can be expected here, too; the staff are ready to answer every request.\n\nClaridge's , Brook Street, Mayfair, London W1K 4HR; + 44 20 7629 8860\n\nChiltern Firehouse\n\nA-list favorite Chiltern Firehouse is located in a Grade 2 listed old fire station. Chiltern Firehouse\n\nUS hotelier Andr\u00e9 Balazs, the man behind Chateau Marmont in Hollywood, is also the leading light behind the Chiltern Firehouse.\n\nWe're including this hotel as it has a unique and different position -- we think of it as a never-ending exclusive house party.\n\nThe building itself is an attractive Grade 2 listed old fire station that's been rebuilt with a gated garden.\n\nAlthough it does not have all the usual luxury options -- such as a gym, spa, pool, multiple restaurants and a lobby -- as a hotel guest you do get automatic entrance to a buzzing scene, which is pretty much otherwise off limits.\n\nThe rooms are charming, homely and very comfortable (all with working fireplaces). The hotel itself is family friendly, and children are welcome, though mainly adults stay here.\n\nStaffs are super attentive and their striking outfits add to the old-fashioned glamor.\n\nOur favorite place to relax here is in the lantern-lit courtyard or at the wonderful Ladder Shed bar.\n\nThe courtyard terrace shuts at 9 p.m., so be sure to go for early drinks while you can.\n\nChiltern Firehouse , 1 Chiltern St, Marylebone, London W1U 7PA; +44 20 7073 7676\n\nRosewood\n\nLuxury hotel Rosewood is housed in a 1914 Edwardian building. Rosewood Hotels & Resorts\n\nSet in a magnificent Belle \u00c9poque building, its grand fa\u00e7ade, wrought iron gates and interior courtyard make you feel as if you've stepped back in time.\n\nLocated in High Holborn, Rosewood is walking distance from many of the city's major attractions.\n\nFrom the outside, the building is imposing, with an elegant courtyard designed for horse-drawn carriages and a 166 feet dome.\n\nDesigned by Tony Chi & Associates, its d\u00e9cor is quintessentially British, yet unusual -- whimsical even -- but many of the original listed features (the Grand Pavonazzo marble staircase and the 166 feet cupola, for example) remain intact\n\nYou can expect excellent food and drink in the restaurants and bar, which are destinations in their own right, and a great spa and fitness center. The staff members at Rosewood are welcoming, and although it's a large hotel, it feels boutique and personal.\n\nAs for activities for kids, there are Rose Buds music, art, wildlife or food activities on offer and the concierge can arrange trips to the London Zoo, Hamleys and London Dungeons.\n\nRosewood , 252 High Holborn, London WC1V 7EN; +44 20 7781 8888\n\nThe Wellesley\n\nThe Wellesley Hotel was formerly an underground station. The Wellesley\n\nNow one of London's hippest under-the-radar luxury hideaways, this discreet, stylish Knightsbridge hotel began its life as Hyde Park Corner Station, designed by English architect Leslie Green.\n\nThe rooms are not huge, but it's the place to stay if you wish to keep a low profile or are simply looking for a stylish luxury boutique hotel in the capital.\n\nClaiming to be London's \"first boutique-grand hotel,\" we love its sophisticated Art Deco glamor and excellent service.\n\nAdd to this good food, a buzzing jazz lounge, a chic bar serving clarets, whiskeys, Champagnes and cigars from the hotel's own humidor and it becomes clear why The Wellesley made our list.\n\nIts small colonnade lobby is magnificent, decked with bespoke crystal chandeliers, mirrored paneling, a gleaming stone floor and impressive bronze doors.\n\nThe hotel welcomes children and families should either book The Wellesley Penthouse, which has four interconnecting rooms, or one of the two-bedroom Suites. PlayStation, mini-robes and children's slippers are available on request.\n\nThe Wellesley, 11 Knightsbridge, Belgravia, London SW1X 7LY; +44 20 7235 3535\n\nOur conclusion\n\nFor a classically English experience Claridge's is our top choice (with The Goring following closely behind).\n\nIf you seek a larger international style hotel with a full complement of services, then we suggest the Corinthia or the Rosewood.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/best-luxury-hotels-london/index.html", "published": "2018-04-26T14:12:39+00:00"}, {"title": "Visiting the London Eye? Here's our best advice", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Originally designed as a temporary attraction to celebrate the new Millennium, the London Eye has long surpassed its intended five-year shelf life to become the most popular paid-for attraction in the UK.\n\nStanding 443 feet tall over the River Thames, each 30-minute rotation grants ever-changing, 360-degree views spanning the length and breadth of London (and beyond, if the weather plays ball).\n\nFirst things first -- it's not a Ferris wheel. It is, in fact, a \"cantilevered observation wheel,\" with 32 fully enclosed capsules moving at a leisurely 0.6 miles an hour. If you're superstitious, don't panic -- it seems the designers were as well, so there's no capsule number 13.\n\nEach capsule fits up to 25 people, but there's enough space for you to walk around and see how many landmarks you can spot. If you want a bit of privacy (or to join the more than 5000 people who have proposed on the wheel) then you can book a 'Cupid's Capsule' for two, Champagne included.\n\nBefore you travel here, check out our tips on when to visit the London Eye, how to buy tickets and how to get there so you can spend less time on logistics and more time gawking:\n\nAvoid peak times\n\nBear in mind that the crowds (and lines) are almost inevitable. There are two ways to make life easier\u2014by avoiding peak times, or by paying a little extra.\n\nThe London Eye is busiest between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. during the UK school holidays, and is quieter at the beginning and end of their opening hours, which vary throughout the year. As a rough guide, summer hours are 10am -- 8.30pm, and winter hours are 11am -- 6pm, but do check in advance on their site. It's worth bearing in mind that it closes for around two weeks every January, for annual maintenance.\n\nBuy tickets online\n\nUpon arrival, there are three lines\u2014one to buy a ticket, one for fast track boarding and one for standard boarding.\n\nBuying tickets online will allow you to skip the initial ticket office line and also save you 10%, if you book more than 24 hours in advance. You will, however, be tying yourself into a timeslot, unless you opt for an Any Time Flexi ticket. All of which would be fine, if the unpredictability of the London climate wasn't an issue\u2014if your visit coincides with fog, or rain, you might not get the same out of it.\n\nIf you want to avoid waiting as much as possible, your best bet is buying a Fast Track ticket, which can be bought on the day or online (again, with a 10% discount and the bonus of skipping the ticket office line). It's an extra cost, but will grant you fast track entry through a dedicated entrance.\n\nTravel by train\n\nWaterloo station (served by the tube and overland trains) is the closest to the London Eye, at just a five-minute walk away. Both Embankment and Charing Cross are fairly close, at around a ten-minute walk. Westminster station is a short and picturesque walk over the river.\n\nWestminster station is a short and picturesque walk over the river, where you'll also find the Houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and Big Ben. Head in the other direction and you can walk along the river through South Bank, with its skateboarders, secondhand book stalls and food trucks\u2014a Bleecker burger is one of the best in town.

It's recognition of the progress we've made,\" said Doug Edward, who after 10 years of captaining the first team will miss the game through injury.\n\n\"We don't get paid to play but we've been out since 1991 going to some rough parts of London to play football,\" he said.\n\nThe club hopes to use the platform of Friday's game to continue normalizing their presence in the sport.\n\n\"The progress we've made in challenging stereotypes and educating people in the fight against homophobia is huge and this is the pinnacle,\" Stonewall manager Eric Najib Armanazim told CNN Sport.\n\n\"Maybe in a few years, we won't have to say Stonewall FC, the gay team. But instead just Stonewall FC.\"\n\nClub captain Doug Edward will miss the game through injury but is excited for his teammates.\n\nThe club was set up in 1991 as a way of allowing openly gay men to play football in London and it now boasts three teams competing at various standards of grassroots football.\n\nAnd quite successfully at that, reaching the final of every LGBT tournament that they've entered since 2000.\n\n\"I just can't believe we've got this far, that wasn't the plan at the beginning.

Thus, it was decreed that Thanksgiving should be followed by Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday.\n\nBut when it was pointed out six years ago that three days of commercial exploitation was now heavily overbalancing a single Thanksgiving day allocated for wholesome domesticity, the 92nd Street Y and the United Nations Foundation came up with yet another add-on: Giving Tuesday.\n\nThis Tuesday, Americans will be encouraged to give to charity a portion of the disposable income they usually throw at Thanksgiving, particularly through groups which advise and educate on sustainable giving.\n\nKate Maltby\n\nDonating while you spend is an old tradition, embedded in many of the world's major religions. If you can treat yourself on Black Friday, you can afford to buy a gift for someone less fortunate -- that's an idea with roots in the old Christian and Jewish system of tithing or the Islamic zakat.\n\nI was recently told a story about a well-known American dynasty who traditionally raise their children with the following approach to sustainable wealth management and philanthropy: for every $3 pocket money, you should save one, spend one and give one. It's standard throughout the world to link one's capacity and responsibility for philanthropy directly to one's disposable income.\n\nRead More\n\nThis year, however, Giving Tuesday is trying to go global. Which is a tough sell, given its links to the all-American festival of Thanksgiving. Twenty-first century capitalism crosses borders; patriotism slightly less so. Here in London, my friends and I have been bombarded with advertisements for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. (What Amazon can flog in Boston, Amazon will flog in Belgravia.) Small Business Saturday has also taken off, largely as a social media opportunity for UK politicians to be photographed enthusiastically at small businesses in their constituency. (The basics of local politics also cross borders.) Unmoored from any connection with Thanksgiving, it is marked on the first Saturday in December as a build-up to Christmas shopping. JUST WATCHED This is how Black Friday began Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This is how Black Friday began 00:42 And it's not just the UK that's cashing in this week. Amazon France excitedly informed its customers today: \"Les ventes flash Cyber Monday sont l\u00e0!\" In Germany, it's \"Cyber-Monday-Woche,\" with appropriate compound nouns. What's missing from this international extension of the Thanksgiving franchise is much of the altruistic spirit that gives an American Thanksgiving its warm and cuddly heart. Millennial Europeans are pretty familiar with the concept of Thanksgiving, thanks to the cultural saturation of American sitcoms, but older generations see little reason in marking a festival dedicated to the American historical memory. (And why should we? The early history of the modern American nation wasn't exactly marked by intermittent transatlantic friendship parades.) When it comes to the last week of November, we do the shopping, we do more shopping, but we don't waste time focusing on motherhood, pecan pie or philanthropy. That could be changing in the UK. Some UK millennials, the generation most thoroughly interlinked with American culture online, have begun to mark Thanksgiving as an opportunity for a \"Friendsgiving.\" We're a generation which invests social value heavily in our friendship circles and we find returning to our families a bit of a drag at Christmas -- so we're predisposed to fetishize a 'pre-Christmas' turkey alternative with the people who matter most, our peers.

It's harder to get into a fight about the erasure of Native American peoples -- rightly or wrongly -- when you're not actually eating turkey on the site of their removal. So perhaps British millennials, too, could get on board with the concept of Giving Tuesday. Like their American counterparts, young Brits are heavily concerned with social justice, organized politically online and keen to demonstrate their moral superiority over their parents. The only problem is that, as with voting, it can be difficult to get them to put their money where their mouth is. Here's hoping that when next year's Cyber Monday goes international, the world's online retailers have gotten smarter about tying their promotions to opportunities to give.

Modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily, my Presidential Weekly Briefing focuses on the topics and issues President Trump needs to know to make informed decisions.\n\nHere's this week's briefing:\n\nImmigration: Relationship goals with Mexico\n\nYour plan to make Central American immigrants wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed -- along with your threats to close the border entirely -- could put a serious strain on Mexican resources, and your own budding relationship with President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. While Mexico's incoming government has denied there is an official deal , we assess that any extended \"remain in Mexico\" policy will have adverse consequences for the bilateral relationship. If your relationship goal is to create tensions with Mexico, extended stays for Central American migrants in Mexico or derogatory statements about Mexico's own border security will do the trick.\n\nUnder your new plan, some of the asylum seekers currently at our southern border may be allowed to wait in the US while their applications are being processed. But the majority will likely be forced to stay in Mexico for an indeterminate time. The migrants will need food, housing, healthcare and other basic needs while they wait, and it remains unclear whether the population influx will raise any tensions in Mexico. While the Mexican economy rebounded last quarter, domestic poverty and inequality remain high . Obrador campaigned on giving money to Mexicans in need, not Central American migrants that the US does not want to take.\n\nOver time, Obrador, who takes office December 1, may grow increasingly upset with your decision to place a strain on Mexican resources in order to save on your own. Obrador's left-wing, populist campaign included promises of raising pensions for the elderly and increasing other social spending. So being asked to spend Mexican money on migrants that he thinks should be allowed in the US -- rather than on programs to help Mexicans in need -- could create a major rift.\n\nSome of the migrants will also end up waiting in dangerous border towns, which presents an additional humanitarian risk, given that Mexico experienced its most murderous year on record in 2017. While we do not share your risk assessment that these migrants are themselves dangerous criminals , we do think that thousands of people who are stranded at a border for an extended period of time could be at risk of criminal activity, especially if they are in areas already prone to violence.\n\nYou are already deeply unpopular in Mexico and your relationship with Obrador could deteriorate quickly as he shores up his footing early in his term. Despite a warm embrace this summer , he could shift gears and direct his ire at you to maintain a strong standing domestically.\n\nSaudi Arabia: Table for two\n\nAccording to our analysis, contradicting the CIA's assessment that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's (MBS) ordered Jamal Khashoggi's murder and giving him a free pass will likely distance you from our other allies and impact our intelligence-sharing partnerships going forward.\n\nWhile the response to Russia's attempted assassination against Sergei Skripal was a multilateral one that resulted in the expulsion of Russian diplomats from more than 20 countries, your unilateral decision not to punish MBS is already causing problems with Turkey. The NATO ally issued a sharp rebuke this week and slammed what they called your \"blind eye\" approach to assigning responsibility for the assassination.\n\nMany of our European allies have already taken action against Saudi Arabia by issuing their own sets of sanctions, while Germany, Denmark, and Finland have gone a step further and suspended arms deals with Saudi Arabia. We could see further action by the European Union as well as individual member states, especially if any intelligence about MBS's direct role in the assassination becomes public. Additional sanctions could involve expelling Saudi diplomats, curtailing business with the Kingdom and publicly calling out the Crown Prince as a murderer. Despite the fact that the US did sanction over a dozen Saudis for the killing, the US could be left standing with Saudi Arabia while all our other allies take stronger action geared at upholding human rights and safeguarding the physical security of their residents.\n\nOur intelligence-sharing relationships are already strained , and our allies may be even less inclined to share valuable information with us if they think you're uninterested in basing policy decisions on these intelligence assessments.\n\nAssange: Is extradition worth it?\n\nNews of the potential criminal charges against Julian Assange broke just days before Jerome Corsi , a Roger Stone associate, confirmed he is discussing a plea agreement with the special counsel's office. Both incidents will likely continue to fuel speculation that a missing link between Russia, WikiLeaks and American individuals may be disclosed in the short term.\n\nBecause the Department of Justice has already charged Russians for hacking information and laundering it through a third party -- \"Organization 1\" (WikiLeaks), charging Assange could be viewed as the first step in a complex process for seeking his release from the Ecuadorian embassy in London. If he is extradited to the United States, he could face trial, potentially on charges related to conspiracy against the US during the 2016 election.\n\nJUST WATCHED Clerical error reveals charges against Assange Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clerical error reveals charges against Assange 02:10\n\nWith the recent departure of Ecuador's ambassador to the UK, and Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno's talks with British authorities about Assange leaving the Ecuadorian embassy, the time may be ripe for increased efforts seeking his extradition to the US.\n\nBut we assess that any successful attempt to extradite Assange will in large part depend on the way the US government approaches Ecuador about the matter. You have previously attacked US courts and judges , and we assess that any critiques of the Justice Department's decision to charge Assange could weaken the diplomatic outreach seeking his release and extradition.\n\nAs you determine whether to personally engage with the government of Ecuador to seek Assange's release or with the British government to seek his extradition, we do want to flag a perception problem. Legal counsel is outside of our purview, so if there is any perception that you are considering curtailing efforts to charge or extradite Assange, those efforts could be viewed internationally as an attempt to interfere with Mueller's investigation into possible links between WikiLeaks and members of your presidential campaign.\n\nBrexit: Why May may need some help\n\nWith the EU's historic \"yes\" vote on the UK's Brexit plan on Sunday, British Prime Minister Theresa May has one final hurdle ahead of her -- her own people. With just months until Britain's official exit date, May now needs to gain Parliamentary approval for the Brexit deal, and we assess that she will face strong opposition to the exit plan from all sides, including from within her own Conservative Party. She may be looking for support wherever she can find it, including from you at the upcoming G20 summit.\n\nCriticisms of May's exit plan traverse a spectrum of complaints, including that the deal is too weak and gives up too much to the EU. In fact, almost no one in the UK or in Brussels is satisfied with the deal\n\nFor more opinion... Sign up for our new newsletter.

That Moscow really seeks to control not just naval traffic in and out of the Sea of Azov, but also the sea itself.\n\nThe goal, they worry, is to dominate the Ukrainian coast between Russia proper and the Crimean peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014. The peninsula is currently only reachable from Russia through an expensive bridge across the Kerch Strait. A land corridor would be a huge advantage.\n\nRead More\n\nFor now, Ukrainian officials say, Russia's measures extend to simply limiting traffic in and out of the sea. \"Russian coast guard ships take under control the civilian ships going to our ports and take some time to check all documents\", said Nosenko. \"More than twenty ships are waiting on that side to proceed to our ports.\" Further along the coast, the media are treated to a show of the strength that Ukraine's military has mustered in the last four years, a display of attack helicopters strafing an empty field, and anti-aircraft guns shooting a flare over the Azov coast. But it isn't going to change Moscow's plans in and of itself. What would is global unified condemnation, but that's been limited. The commander of Ukraine's joint operation, Sergei Naev, told CNN: \"I think that the American leader must say to our enemy to stops his aggression and stop it now.\" With 24 sailors still in Russian prisons and a vital sea route now seized, it seems, Kiev has found itself much more isolated than in 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea. The US has not led the world in further sanctions against Moscow, and instead President Donald Trump has, until his last-minute cancellation of their G20 meeting, entertained a chummy one-on-one with Vladimir Putin. Ukraine has, if you discount the countless rhetoric of \"grave concern\" echoing around European capitals, been left to go it alone. Friday their response gained an edge, when Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted that Russians aged 16 to 60 would be barred from entering Ukraine, the most concrete measure taken yet by Kiev during the 30 days of the martial law they have declared. Ukraine is woefully unprepared to wage a fight with Russia at sea Poroshenko cited the fact that Russian citizens entered illegally in 2014 to foment the unrest in Crimea and the East. But these are two countries that have been symbiotic for decades, and it'll hurt Ukrainians as much as Russians. Clearing leaves up from green areas near Mariupol's under-used railway tracks is a group of Ukrainian women, in orange overalls, who will probably add the ban on Russians to the list of things they blame their president for. \"If we had a normal president would women work like this, in this kind of job?\", asked Maria, as she and her six colleagues raced towards the Biz Cafe near the rail tracks for a short and early lunch. \"I have relatives in Russia,\" interjected Elena. \"We are Russian. I don't understand this kind of conflict.\" In the cutting chill, Poroshenko appears to have taken the blame for the damage the war has done to their hard graft world, while Putin has emerged cleaner, stronger, despite being to blame for the repeated invasions and the threat of another. \"I don't know why [Trump] supports Poroshenko\", said Elena. A third, Anastasia, said: \"I have many Russian friends who worry for us like we worry for them. We need another, good president.\" On a cliff top overlooking the idle port strolls Dimitry Ponomaryo, a little breathless from the steep climb, but his lungs full of the discontent caused by a crashing wartime economy here. \"There is little work here and no one has paid us, we don't have enough money. Russia's don't need to attack, they won't invade.\" He added he thought sanctions would be toughened if Russia invaded, but that Trump was not, at present, being that weak. \"He should talk with Putin but also close the Bosphorus [Strait into the Black Sea] to the Russians and then we will see how they feel.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/europe/ukraine-russia-paton-walsh-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Breaking News, Latest News and Videos", "text": "", "link": "http://cnn.it/2017/03/04/vr/how-to-watch-vr", "published": "2017-03-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "As Tanzania's LGBT fear for their lives, HIV will thrive", "text": "One day, she could walk down the street like anyone else.

She began questioning the world, her life and who she was. \"You start thinking, 'what species am I? Where do I belong?' \"\n\nThe announcement that she says changed her life was made by powerful politician Paul Makonda, regional governor of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's largest city. At the end of October, he vowed to set up a task force to round up and arrest people suspected of being gay.\n\nShe first identified as a trans woman in 2016, having previously considered herself to be a gay man. \"It took courage,\" she said. \"Tanzania is a very religious country.\"\n\nAlthough she was \"very intelligent\" about coming out and about going only to known LGBT-friendly settings, she now feels that things have taken several steps back.\n\nFour weeks ago, she fled her home in Dar es Salaam to go to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, with the help of Kenya-based nongovernmental organization Jinsiangu, which is supported by the International AIDS Alliance and its Rapid Response Fund.\n\n\"It was so bad, I had go,\" she said. The organization gave her transportation and money to relocate and start a new life in Nairobi.\n\n\"I'm free here,\" she said.\n\n'If you know any gays, report them to me'\n\nMakonda's call for all gay people to be reported to him initiated a chain reaction in the country, forcing many into hiding.\n\nStating that his phone number is widely known, \"I am announcing this to every citizen of Dar es Salaam: If you know any gays, report them to me,\" Makonda said at a news conference October 29.\n\nPaul Makonda, a politician in Tanzania, launched an anti-gay crackdown, threatening to arrest people suspected of being homosexuals.\n\nPeople already faced a 30-year jail sentence in Tanzania for gay male sex, a holdover from colonial-era laws, mirroring severe penalties for same-sex relationships across many African countries. As a result of that law, the LGBT community experienced regular discrimination and marginalization.\n\nUnder the administration of President John Magufuli, rights groups believe, the situation has gotten worse, with the closure of LGBT-friendly clinics and prohibition of community organizations that do HIV outreach -- all because of their work on LGBT health and rights.\n\nBut the prospect of a civilian task force scouring the streets and giving civilians the power to report people brought a new level of terror.\n\nAfter intense international pressure, the Tanzanian government tried to distance itself from the controversial governor's plans, stating almost a week after the announcement that Makonda's \"views are not the view of the government.\"\n\nBut the repercussions had begun.\n\nSince the announcement, the International HIV/AIDS Alliance says, it has helped 30 people in Dar es Salaam through the Rapid Response Fund, which provides money to people in dire need within 72 hours. In Tanzania, the grants have provided basics like transport, medical help and shelter.\n\nMany of the people supported this month reported suffering serious injuries as a result of violent attacks, the alliance said.\n\nThose unable to flee are instead pushed underground and into hiding, kept from entering the outside world -- which blocks their access to health services, such as those protecting against HIV/AIDS.\n\nSouth African members of the LGBTQI community protest outside the Tanzania High Commission.\n\n'HIV is so much higher in those populations'\n\nBeing forced to be \"invisible\" due to \"public antagonism\" exposes people to sexual violence and abuse for which they are also not taken seriously by the police, said Christine Stegling, executive director of the International HIV/AIDS Alliance.\n\n\"All those things add to the reasons why HIV is so much higher in those populations,\" she said, explaining that the organization's response grants help get people out of situations where they might more easily become infected.\n\nAccording to 2014 UNAIDS data, 17.6% of men who have sex with men in Tanzania are living with HIV -- a rate more than four times higher than the 4.5% in the nation's general adult population.\n\nA gay man in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who for many years received condoms and medical attention from local outreach efforts, worries about what will happen now that those outreach programs have been suspended for the gay community.\n\nGlobally, according to UNAIDS, new HIV infections among gay men and other men who have sex with men are rising.\n\nThe region where \"HIV rates are highest among men who have sex with men is sub-Saharan Africa, the second highest is the Caribbean, and these are both regions with high social intolerance for same-sex behavior,\" Chris Beyrer, the Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, previously told CNN.\n\n\"It's impossible to say there is direct causality, but there certainly is a very strong correlation.\"\n\nBeing forced into hiding also means people do not want to engage in any way with health services and will not test for infections or go to collect HIV treatment. People will avoid anything that will link them to being LGBT and subject to identification, Stegling said.\n\n\"You have a whole part of the community not engaging in conversations about sex, sexuality and conversations around HIV,\" she said. \"In the last couple of years, there's a really heightened hijacking of rhetoric against gay people as part of local politics, making life very hard for communities ... and to have HIV programs.\"\n\nStegling believes that we're far from meaningfully addressing HIV in marginalized communities.\n\nWe know what to do, but we can't do it, she said. There needs to be more peer-led outreach and services, as government services will not reach vulnerable people in such political climates.\n\nTanzania's Ministry of Health and a government spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'They are making us fear, like we are not human beings'\n\nPeople involved in peer programs in Tanzania risk abuse but believe that in their work to help and educate people about the importance of HIV prevention as well as living with the condition, in addition to ensuring that they know their rights -- keeping them out of prison and away from the risk of infection.\n\n\"People are not free,\" said Faki, whose name has been changed to ensure his safety.

Though the island's prejudice is not as extreme as in Dar es Salaam, he says, his team has helped many LGBT people get out of prison and fight for their rights against local police.

Living in the middle of the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, the city has no other choice. On average, 15 days every year spike over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The city gets little relief with annual rainfall of just about 9 inches. It's one of the hottest cities in the country.\n\nOne of its prime sources of water is the Rio Grande. Typically the river can supply as much as half of the city's water needs. But climate change is making that increasingly difficult and is pushing the city to look for new sources of water. Now, El Paso is on track to become the first large city in the United States to treat its sewage water and send it directly back into its taps.\n\nIncreasing temperatures will make the dry region even more vulnerable to drought, according to the federal government's most recentnational climate assessment. Already challenged with balancing the demands of about 700,000 thirsty El Pasoans along with agriculture and industry needs, El Paso must also face the fact that climate change is literally drying up one of its major sources of water.\n\nAnalyzing tree ring records, scientists have been able to reconstruct the climate history of the region as far as the late 1500s and have found that as temperatures have risen, the amount of snow melting and feeding the Rio Grande has dropped.\n\n\"We're getting less runoff now than we would have gotten as recently as the '80s or '90s,\" said J.

The district manages the water distribution of some 90,000 acres of farmland along the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico and Texas.\n\nKing told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta that there is simply less snowmelt coming from northern New Mexico and southern Colorado to feed the river. Since 1958, the amount of early April snowmelt going into the Rio Grande has dropped 25% due to less snowpack and evaporation.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rio Grande is not unique. It's a phenomenon happening throughout the Western United States.\n\nKing called the Rio Grande a harbinger of what's to come. \"You know we've already gotten critically low here, and you can think of the Colorado as a few years away from a similar fate,\" he said.\n\nDrought isn't anything new for the 1,800-mile long river. The Rio Grande has survived severe and sustained droughts, King said. But an increase in temperature is pushing both a warmer and dryer climate.

It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. The dwindling reserves are apparent at Elephant Butte Reservoir, just outside of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. The reservoir there sits right on the Rio Grande and forms the largest recreational lake in the state. It holds water for farmers fromnorth of El Paso up to Colorado. It has a capacity of about 2 million acre feet, King said. Currently , it's hovering around 3% to 4% of its full capacity. Buildings that were built as offices during the dam's construction in the early part of the 20th century were previously submerged in the 1980s. Now, they serve as lookout points to a nearly empty basin.\n\nFinding alternatives\n\nFor those who rely on the river, like the city of El Paso, they must look for alternative water sources out of necessity.\n\nIt is something that El Paso is used to. When Ed Acrhuleta took the helm of the El Paso Water utility in 1989, he knew that drought was an issue. To make a long-term plan, he needed a long-term outlook. An assessment by the Texas Water Development Board determined that the city could expect to run out of water by 2020 if it continued to rely on pumping groundwater out of its aquifers.\n\n\"I thought, we've got to reverse this mining of the aquifer. We've got to stabilize that aquifer. And we have to diversify our resources,\" he told Gupta.\n\nExpanding the water portfolio was Archuleta's mission. Instead of relying solely on pumped groundwater, Archuleta expanded El Paso's water portfolio.\n\nFarmers in the Western United States typically organized a system of rights or allotments to use water off of the river, including the Rio Grande. The rights were attached to property, so the El Paso utility began leasing water rights from farmers. The utility also bought farmland that carried those rights.\n\nDavid Gutzler, a climatology professor at the University of New Mexico, likened an expanded water portfolio to a financial one. \"If you can mix and match, then you use one or the other,\" Gutzler said. And it's the flexibility that ultimately makes cities more resilient, he said.\n\nBut in a move that was more visionary than just looking for water, Archuleta made water.\n\nHe lobbied the federal government for funds to create the world's largest inland desalination plant. The Kay Bailey Hutchison Desalination Plant is named after the Texas senator who helped Archuleta lobby in DC for the plant.\n\nAccording to El Paso Water's hydrologists, under the 10 million acre feet of fresh water in the Hueco Bolson aquifer it relies on, there is an additional 30 million acre feet of brackish water that can be treated and used as drinking water.\n\nIt's estimated that the entire state of Texas has nearly 3 billion acre feet of salty groundwater to use. That's more than 20,000 times the amount of water El Paso used this year.\n\nProducing water\n\nToda,y the Kay Bailey Hutchison Plant can produce up to 27 million gallons of water daily. The plant scales its production up and down based on how much water is available in the river and its aquifers. Next year, El Paso expects desalination to provide 7% to 9% of its water.\n\n\"This plant was built for growth. It was built for drought protection. It basically gives El Paso an insurance policy against drought,\" Archuleta said.\n\nHe also preached a gospel of conservation. He established community outreach programs with a mascot called Willie the Water Drop and created a museum about water for area children to visit and learn where their water came from.\n\nThe city paid residents to turn their grassy yards into rockscapes. The El Paso paper published the names of high water users.\n\nWhen Archuleta retired in 2013, water consumption had dropped by about 35% per person. El Paso uses less total water now than it did 24 years ago, despite having 170,000 more people to serve.\n\nDrinking treated sewage\n\nToday, El Paso is ready to take the next step in expanding its water portfolio. It is building a closed loop system that will treat sewage water and turn it directly into drinking water. Among water professionals, it's called \"direct potable reuse\" or \"advanced purification.\"\n\n\"It's the logical next step for us to take,\" said Gilbert Trejo, the chief technical officer of El Paso Water.\n\nEl Paso; Orange County, California; Scottsdale, Arizona, and several other utilities across the country treat sewage water and then pump it back into the aquifer to ultimately drink. Trejo says it can take about five years for the water to filter through the ground before being pumped back out and treated to the standards of clean drinking water.\n\nThis treated water is also frequently used for irrigation and industrial purposes.\n\nEl Paso is building a completely closed loop facility; instead of being pumped back into the aquifer, the treated sewage water will undergo additional filtration and then be sent back into drinking water pipelines.\n\n\"We see this water that's clear and it's of good quality,\" Trejo explained to Gupta. \"The next thing for us to do is to take a high-quality water we produce at a state-of-the-art facility and then treat it a little bit more with multiple treatment processes so we can drink it.\"\n\nAccording to the EPA , the amount of wastewater produced in large cities can represent 50% to 60% of the total water supplied, providing a massive resource for cities like El Paso that are scouring for water.\n\nclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration. To make sure the water isclean of any pathogens or microbes, treated sewage water is sent through multiple steps of filtration, including UV and carbon filtration.

Community buy-in is key to getting these projects launched, said Justin Mattingly of the Water Research Foundation. \"These are public agencies. They belong to the public. So you might as well ingratiate the public as well.\"\n\nArchuelta's legacy of water conservation and education has primed El Paso for this moment.\n\n\"Everybody sees that we're in the desert that we're in an arid climate. Rain is scarce ... so when we tell our customers that we're doing everything possible and using every water resource around us to treat and make it safe for consumption, they take it pretty well.\"\n\nBy 2030, El Paso Water expects that desalination will produce 10% of its water supply, and 6% will of come from advanced purification.\n\nTrejo told Gupta that it's not just the future for El Paso, it's the future for many other cities also faced with having to look for water.\n\n\"Technology allows us to treat [water] to a very high standard and makes it very safe to drink. Water really is all around us in every city.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/health/water-climate-change-el-paso/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "This town is like thousands that are vulnerable to contaminated water, with no fix in sight", "text": "(CNN) Virginia Tech engineering Professor Marc Edwards watched as water flowed from a garden hose in Enterprise, Louisiana.

He says his wife drives 20 miles each direction to do laundry in a town with clear water.\n\nConcerned about the potential health effects for his family, including his two daughters, he ran for a seat on the local water board.\n\nWhat drives him, Tiser said, is \"being sure that they're not consuming anything that 20 years from now is going to wind up hurting them.\"\n\nYears of water system neglect means that the 250-or-so residents there are left with pipes that leak more than 70% of their water into the ground, Tiser said -- all because they can't afford to fix them.\n\n\"We're basically putting Band-Aids when we need to go to the ER. That's where we're at,\" he said.\n\nIt's what Edwards calls America's \"dirty little secret.\" He explains it this way: That often times towns like Enterprise are stuck with aging infrastructure that they can't fix, leaving few options for them to deal with complaints about dirty or contaminated water.\n\nThe US Environmental Protection Agency says the nation needs $743 billion to fix America's water system.\n\nIn his wife's minivan, complete with acid stains on the carpet, Edwards says he makes long drives to small towns that are hurt by dwindling populations, and slowly being forgotten. \"It's the perfect vehicle. I couldn't take a rental car, because I can't explain why there's acid burns in the seats of those. But that van's seen a lot of bad water,\" he said.\n\nEdwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state, and local governments on water quality. His work helped to reveal high levels of lead in the water in Flint, Michigan.\n\nEdwards says Virginia Tech, where he is a professor, supports his work, as long as he can afford to pay for his travel, which he has done for years.\n\nPhotos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Enterprise, Louisiana, resident Jodie Vinson holds a bottle of water from her tap Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Lead, bacteria and other contaminants found in Louisiana town's water Virginia Tech Professor Marc Edwards, left, samples Enterprise's water, which was found to have bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.

But, states can't afford to swoop into every town and fix the aging pipes in homes, buildings and structures. In many cases, that falls to property owners.\n\n\"I'm not blaming anyone for what happened,\" says Edwards. \"We put these communities in an impossible situation. We say, 'Here are the federal laws. You figure out how to meet them,' and when they can't, no one's there to help them.\"\n\nAn expensive problem\n\nIn 2017, Edwards and a team of scientific and academic researchers tested the water in Enterprise and found bacteria, lead and other contaminants that exceeded EPA limits.\n\nResident Jodie Vinson ticks off the repairs that have cost her family over $10,000 due to corrosive water. \"Just in the last four years that I've been here, we've been through three hot water heaters,\" she said. \"We have gotten all new plumbing in the house. Then as far as faucets, we've been through, I guess, two in the back bathroom and two in the front. So four faucets. And they're already in bad shape.\"\n\nIt's an expensive problem, and each week she says she buys about 10 cases of bottled water.\n\nAnd, for the past year and a half, Vinson says, she and her family have been routinely sick, as they battle their tap water. Vinson says doctors told her she has H. pylori bacteria, and her son, Blake, had bouts of coughing, bronchitis and respiratory infections. Last year, she was hospitalized with bacterial meningitis. She blames the water. \"I cannot say that the water made us sick but I can say I have proof that it causes what we have,\" she said. \"So we don't know and we never know and you're afraid to drink it and you're afraid to open your mouth in the shower.\"\n\nVinson's water provider, Enterprise Waterworks Inc. sends out periodic \"boil water notices\" warning customers of things like \"questionable microbiological quality.\" It's something everyone is more than aware of.\n\nWhen CNN was in Enterprise to meet with Vinson, her home was under a boil water advisory. However, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that boiling water with lead in it, can actually make the level of lead higher. Medical experts warn there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\n\"...so if you boil the water to get the bacteria out then you're making the lead content worse and more dangerous in the water,\" said Vinson. \"So you really don't know what to do.\"\n\nLouisiana alone would need about $10 billion to fix its water system. That's money it does not have, the office of Gov. John Bel Edwards told CNN.\n\nHe's put together a committee to help Enterprise and nine other communities in the state deemed the most \"distressed.\"\n\n\"Systems are going to continue to age and degrade,\" the governor told CNN affiliate KNOE in November 2017. \"But we are more constrained than we would like to be and therefore cannot invest in all these improvements like we'd like to.\"\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers has given the United States a grade of D when it comes to drinking water infrastructure. While the majority of the country receives safe drinking water, the EPA says thousands of systems in rural America are deemed \"serious\" violators of federal law because they don't meet federal standards.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nThe EPA told CNN that more than 300 million Americans depend on 50,000 community water systems across the country for safe, reliable water every day. Over 92% of the population supplied by community water systems receives drinking water that meets all health-based standards all of the time.\n\n\"The United States has world-class drinking water standards for more than 90 contaminants, including microorganisms, disinfectants, disinfection byproducts, inorganic and organic chemicals, and radionuclides-providing Americans safe and healthy water to drink,\" the EPA said.\n\nBut, a 2018 EPA report found that nationwide, nearly one-third of the nation's public water systems had at least one violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act. Those systems serve more than 87 million Americans.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA reported nearly 8% had violations of health-based standards. About 3% of public water systems were serious violators, typically with multiple violations over a sustained period.\n\nBut, multiple government reports over the years show that the water quality issue may possibly be much worse, especially in rural America, because local communities may not always be accurately reporting their data.\n\nIn a May EPA report , the agency's inspector general said, \"This situation can lead to conditions where the EPA and public may not know if water arriving at taps meets national drinking water standards.\"\n\n\"Drinking water is a fundamental human right,\" said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat from Flint who has been dealing with the fallout of a town reeling from lead poisoning since 2014. \"It's something that's necessary to sustain human life, and so it's hard to think of a more important priority for every level of government.\"\n\nKildee says he often hears from other members of Congress who suspect water issues in their towns, but can't get help from the local leadership. And, he says, the federal government just isn't motivated to take on the true cost to fix the problem.\n\nThe EPA estimates $132.3 billion is needed to repair small water systems in America over the next 20 years. But, in 2017, only $805.7 million was allocated to these systems -- about 12% of the amount needed.\n\n\"They don't want to talk about it. Because, they understand that there's a consequence that comes with it,\" Kildee said, referencing the financial consequence of dealing with failing infrastructure. \"I think a lot of people in public office just want to kick the can down the road until they're not around anymore.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one party that can be held accountable for it.\"\n\n'We're third-world when it comes to drinking water'\n\n\"If we don't fix this problem, a whole lot of people get hurt when they're being told there's nothing to worry about,\" said Virginia Tech's Edward. \"And I can't live in a world where that's allowed to happen. ... The reality is, yeah we're third-world when it comes to drinking water in these poorer communities. That's the reality.\"\n\n\"There's never a ribbon cutting ceremony when you fix an underground, dirty water pipe, and that's why we typically invest more in bridges and airports and other things that can be a showcase,\" said Edwards. \"But the danger from these pipes is real.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nTiser, the Enterprise water board president, says all levels of government have failed by taking no real action taken over the years to fix the problems. \"We get the aging infrastructure and we're occurring debt every month just to try to stay afloat,\" he said, noting that when he became a member of the water board, \"I had no idea that we were half a million dollars in debt.\"\n\nAs the cost goes up, so do the water bills, placing the financial burden on the shoulders of 200 households, \"and we don't have clean water on top of that,\" he added.\n\nBecause Enterprise is in debt, the Louisiana governor's office says the town is not eligible to apply for the grants to communities to improve bad water systems.\n\n\"It boils my blood to know that somebody can sit up there and say 'They just have to deal with it,' \" said Tiser. \"The only way they're gonna get any help is if the water tower blows over.\" He went on to say, \"This is supposedly God's country we are our brother's keepers right?

CNN chose to quote directly from the documents rather than use vague or euphemistic language that fails to convey the violence of the crimes. Reporters were unable to identify and reach most victims because police redacted their names, addresses and other identifying information in the case files. Where police did not redact that information, CNN did, including the full names of suspects who were not charged.\n\nHours after you are raped, you sit in a hospital room, under fluorescent lights, and consent to a forensic exam. Your body is the crime scene. When did it happen, a nurse asks. Where did it happen? Can you tell me who did this to you? The nurse is trained to interview you and search your body for evidence left behind by your attacker. Knowing the details of your assault guides the examination. Did he ejaculate inside of you, on you? Where did he touch you? Did he use any objects? Did he kiss you, lick you? Have you had anything to drink? Did you shower? You\u2019re asked to undress slowly while you stand on a special sheet meant to collect any trace evidence that shakes loose. For three to five hours, the nurse swabs your mouth, your breasts, a bite mark on your neck. She scrapes under your fingernails, combs your pubic hair. She inserts a speculum inside you and drops blue dye on the tissue there to illuminate any places that are torn. The nurse cuts a hair from your head. She takes photographs of your face and shoulders to pair with your chart, of you in the clothes you wore when you were attacked. Every injury is photographed, too \u2014 far away, close-up, with a ruler to show size. When the exam is over, the nurse puts hair, fibers, swabs, vials of blood and urine in a container smaller than a shoebox. She seals it \u2014 your rape kit \u2014 and entrusts it to a police officer. This North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed. Read her full story here: \u2018They treated me like trash.\u2019 Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN This is the way DNA evidence is collected. This is what you endure so police can identify your assailant, make him pay for what he did. No one tells you that the exam may be pointless \u2014 that police might treat your kit like trash. A CNN investigation into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute. The number is likely higher and was arrived at through an analysis of the departments\u2019 own records. The destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete investigations that relegated rape kits to shelves in police evidence rooms until they were destroyed. Dozens were trashed mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence, records showed. Almost 80% were never tested for DNA evidence, a process that can identify a suspect or link that person to other crimes. For the past several years, public attention has focused on the hundreds of thousands of kits that have languished untested. The Justice Department has awarded more than $150 million to test that backlog. But destruction of rape kits is a lesser-known and more fundamental problem: The evidence is gone. It can never be used to lock up a rapist or set free the wrongfully convicted. Rape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN \u201cAll the attention toward untested kits isn\u2019t enough if we have agencies destroying kits,\u201d said Wayne County, Michigan, Prosecutor Kym Worthy, whose testing of some 10,000 backlogged rape kits has identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. \u201cEach one of these kits represents a victim,\u201d said the Detroit-based prosecutor. \u201cWhat you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\u201d What you are doing [\u2026] is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice. Kym Worthy | Wayne County, Michigan, prosecutor A woman who reported being gang-raped in 2007 said it was \u201cabsolutely devastating\u201d to recently learn that police destroyed her untested kit. She remembered the nurse at a hospital in Fayetteville, North Carolina, asking her to describe what the four men did so that her body could be positioned in a way that allowed for more precise examination. \u201cIt was very invasive,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was very degrading. The level of exposure \u2026 was a second violation.\u201d But she steeled herself because the nurse was collecting evidence, and she believed police would test it and use it in their investigation. Instead, CNN found, the detective assigned to her case did nothing more than interview her. The officer never tried to talk to the men she named as her attackers, misinterpreted the law and concluded that no rape occurred. About a month after speaking with the woman, the detective authorized destruction of the untested rape kit \u2014 in a state where there was no time limit to prosecute rape. \u201cI counted on the police to do what they were supposed to do \u2014 to investigate what happened to me and to test that evidence,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, they treated it like trash. They treated me like trash.\u201d For some victims, the rape exam feels like a second trauma. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Veteran sex crimes investigators, along with experts in the law, trauma and forensic science, reviewed case files for CNN. They said investigations indicated that police lacked training in how to interact with victims of sexual violence; in the importance of testing kits, not only to solve the reported assaults but potentially other crimes; and in the need to preserve kits for the length of time the law allows for a prosecution. \u201cWhat CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\u201d said Joanne Archambault, a retired sergeant who ran the San Diego Police sex crimes unit for a decade. She examined 56 case files from more than a dozen departments. What CNN discovered is a systemic problem. Joanne Archambault | Former head of San Diego Police sex crimes unit \u201cIt\u2019s simple \u2014 but it\u2019s not the norm \u2014 that law enforcement should keep evidence at least for the statute of limitations,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are mistakes in these cases, but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\u201d Twenty-five agencies in 14 states destroyed kits tied to cases while they could still be prosecuted. Department leaders at some agencies defended the destruction by saying officers approved disposal of kits in closed cases they believed had no chance of moving forward. This was a routine process, they said, done to make space in evidence rooms. Who destroyed? Law enforcement agencies responded to CNN\u2019s findings. At least five departments acknowledged that the decision to destroy kits was made without considering the statutes of limitations. Three stopped trashing kits because of CNN\u2019s inquiries. Experts said the destruction shows that rape is treated differently than other violent crimes. \u201cWould we test all the evidence\u201d in a murder? \u201cYou bet,\u201d said police trainer Tom Tremblay. The former Vermont police chief, who has reviewed rape investigations for the US Department of Justice, examined cases from nine agencies. The language police sometimes used, he and other experts said, suggested bias \u2014 describing victims\u2019 accounts of their rapes as \u201chaving sex,\u201d asking whether victims experienced orgasms and focusing on a victim\u2019s behavior rather than the suspect\u2019s. All of it, Tremblay said, communicates one thing to a victim: You are not believed. Kym Worthy: The prosecutor is herself a rape survivor. She calls the destruction of rape kits a betrayal. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Worthy understands personally what\u2019s at stake. She isn\u2019t just a prosecutor; she\u2019s a survivor. She was raped in law school, she said, and \u2014 like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally \u2014 chose not to report her attack. It is a triumph, Worthy said, when a victim musters the courage to go to police and consent to a rape exam. And destroying a rape kit is a betrayal.\n\nDuring a life-threatening trauma like rape, the defense circuitry of the brain drives the victim\u2019s sole objective: to survive. Reflexes govern reaction \u2014 running away, punching the attacker, lying there paralyzed. Stress hormones can impair a victim\u2019s memory and the ability to make complex, rational decisions. Investigators trained in the effects of trauma know that a victim\u2019s first account of an assault may not be complete, experts said, and it may not be the best time to ask some questions. Yet documents CNN examined showed officers sometimes asked questions that threatened to overwhelm victims or put them on the defensive. Did you say no? Did you fight back? Why didn\u2019t you call police right away? Though experts say victims should be interviewed wherever they feel most comfortable, documents showed police sometimes ask them to come to the station, just as they do suspects. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A traumatized person\u2019s instinct is often to avoid the pain that can come from retelling or reliving the experience. Avoidance and withdrawal are common symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome. But when victims pulled away from investigations soon after they reported being assaulted, when the trauma was fresh, some police officers were quick to label them uncooperative and close their cases. \u201cWe\u2019re trained to sniff out the liar,\u201d said Justin Boardman, a former Utah police detective who teaches cops how to understand trauma. \u201cSo when you don\u2019t give us this training that says \u2014 \u2018Oh, she\u2019s pulling away because she\u2019s traumatized, or she can\u2019t tell me this detail because she legit can\u2019t remember\u2019 \u2014 we think she\u2019s lying or she\u2019s hiding something.\u201d Experts who reviewed cases said detectives appeared to rush victims into making consequential decisions, effectively ending some cases. They noted that investigators violated longstanding best practices by asking victims if they wanted to prosecute their attackers soon after reporting the assaults to police \u2014 sometimes the same day. That question, they said, can intimidate victims and cause them to withdraw. Resources For help, survivors can call 800-656-4673. More guidance for victims and training for investigators can be found here. Prosecution should be discussed only after a thorough investigation is complete, experts said, when a prosecutor \u2014 not a victim \u2014 has determined that charges can be filed. Some victims who expressed reluctance to proceed with a prosecution were asked to sign forms attesting to that. But victims should not be given waivers declining prosecution, according to guidelines by the International Association of Chiefs of Police as far back as 2005. Only the statute of limitations should constrain a victim\u2019s right to change her or his mind about moving forward with a prosecution, the association says. More recently issued guidelines also stress that an investigator should try to spend time building rapport with a victim. Unless the public is in imminent danger, law enforcement should work at a pace comfortable for the victim. Some case files showed detectives closed cases and called victims uncooperative if they didn\u2019t meet arbitrary deadlines. In North Charleston, South Carolina, a woman reported being raped at knifepoint by a man who had once been a sexual partner. Police noted she\u2019d been arrested for prostitution two years earlier and quizzed her about whether he was a client. She told them no. Though she did not know her assailant\u2019s name, she called police twice after her initial interview with information she thought might help identify him, according to the case file. But when she failed to return a detective\u2019s call in a week\u2019s time, he wrote that she was uncooperative and ended the investigation 17 days after she reported being raped. Her kit \u2014 never tested \u2014 was destroyed less than a year later, even though testing might have identified the man. There was no statute of limitations on the crime, meaning the woman should have had as much time as she needed to help police pursue her assailant. Rape survivors expect the evidence taken from their bodies to be sealed up, given to police and sent to a lab for testing. CNN found hundreds of kits were destroyed without being analyzed. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN North Charleston\u2019s detective bureau commander, Major Scott Perry, declined to specify why the kit was destroyed. \u201cEach case is evaluated on its own facts,\u201d he said, adding that the investigation could be reopened at any time if the victim re-approached police. He conceded, however, that not having the rape kit would make the case \u201cmore difficult to prosecute.\u201d In Springfield, Missouri, police labeled victims uncooperative when they didn\u2019t respond to letters mailed to their homes warning that they had 10 business days to contact a detective or their assaults would not be further investigated. In at least six cases, records show, a detective sent the letter the day the officer was assigned to investigate. The victims had undergone rape exams and given initial accounts to patrol officers, actions that demonstrated a desire for the crimes to be investigated. But when victims didn\u2019t meet that 10-day deadline, Springfield police sometimes sent another letter, telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d to respond led to the closing of their cases. The kits were later destroyed, even though the crimes remained within the statutes of limitations. \u2018Failure\u2019 to cooperate When Springfield victims didn\u2019t meet detectives\u2019 deadlines, police sent another letter telling victims their \u201cfailure\u201d led to the closing of their cases. Source: Springfield Police Department Springfield Police Chief Paul Williams said the 10-day letter is a tool used in all kinds of cases to spur a victim to work with police. He said investigators should use it only as a last resort \u2014 after a detective has exhausted every other means to reach a victim. He did not explain why some letters were sent immediately after victims reported being raped. The letter is \u201ca way to justify not doing your job,\u201d said Archambault, the retired San Diego sex crimes investigator who reviewed cases. It should never be sent to rape victims, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous. This type of response will guarantee that the majority of victims will not participate in the investigation.\u201d Victims sometimes leave their homes because they are afraid an attacker will find them again. It\u2019s \u201cabsurd,\u201d she said, to expect victims to check the mail and respond to a demand. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that [victims] are being uncooperative. They\u2019re just dealing with survival. They\u2019re trying to get out of bed, get their clothes on, get to work, get the kids to school,\u201d Archambault said. Police should instead give victims time \u2014 and access to counseling and services that help them feel safe, experts said. After that, they are far more likely to work with law enforcement. Joanne Archambault: The former sex crimes investigator says police label victims uncooperative, but \u201cthey\u2019re just dealing with survival.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN A woman in West Valley, Utah, said she told police she was terrified that her rapist would hunt her down again, but she received neither time nor support. According to her case file, the woman told a patrol officer that a man she\u2019d broken up with came to her home and raped her. He ordered her to \u201cshut her mouth,\u201d or he would \u201churt her,\u201d she told the officer. He forced her into his car. She said she eventually managed to jump out and run into a K-Mart, where someone called 911. The woman gave police an initial statement about the assault and underwent a rape exam. Ten days later, on January 27, 2009, Detective Ryan Humphrey noted that she called him. She said she was \u201cscared to pursue charges,\u201d he wrote in the case file. He shut down the investigation. CNN reached the woman, who was upset to learn that her rape kit was destroyed and never tested. She called the failure to analyze it \u201cpathetic.\u201d Police did not offer to take steps to protect her, she said. If they had, she might have gained confidence and worked with police. She said she wishes they\u2019d told her, \u201c\u2018Well, we can still help you through this.\u2019\u201d (She asked that her name be withheld, and CNN does not typically identify sexual assault victims.) Humphrey, who no longer works for the department, said that in the 10 days between the woman\u2019s report and her phone call, he did not try to locate and interview the suspect or do any other work on the case. Like investigators at other agencies, Humphrey said resources were tight, and he struggled under the weight of a heavy caseload. He closed the investigation, he said, because he assumed that the district attorney wouldn\u2019t file charges in a case without a victim\u2019s cooperation. As he reflected on the case, he acknowledged he could have given the woman more time by leaving the case open and trying to build trust and rapport with her. He could have done what experts said is protocol: offer her a safety plan to allay her fears, such as patrolling near her home or helping her file a restraining order. He agreed that the woman could have changed her mind and re-engaged when she was ready \u2014 her right in a state that had no statute of limitations to prosecute rape at the time she reported the crime. \u201cObviously, she wanted to pursue it,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she went to the hospital and had a rape exam done.\u201d A specially trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner may spend three to five hours or more gathering evidence from a victim\u2019s body. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Humphrey said he did not authorize destruction of the woman\u2019s rape kit but understood that once he closed a case, the evidence would be disposed. Her kit should have been preserved, he said. Not keeping the investigation open was \u201ca mistake. I look back at this case and can see that\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are many obstacles to a successful rape investigation. A victim is too scared to continue working with police. A suspect claims sex was consensual. Testing a kit doesn\u2019t crack a case. But those circumstances shouldn\u2019t necessarily end an investigation. Officers can press pause and set cases aside, then reopen them if there\u2019s a break \u2014 a victim changes his or her mind, new leads emerge, technology improves and evidence can be retested. Yet CNN identified 17 departments that destroyed a combined 92 kits in sex crimes investigations that police described as open or in other terms that mean the same thing, such as inactive or suspended. In Idaho, Coeur d\u2019Alene Police Chief Lee White acknowledged that his department discarded rape kits in cases marked inactive. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cit appears we were too quick at the trigger to dispose.\u201d In Farmington, New Mexico, police reported destroying kits in at least eight cases labeled inactive. Chief Steve Hebbe reviewed those cases and said the kits should not have been trashed. He then ordered a major change. \u201cWe will not destroy sexual assault kits,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy them until after the statute of limitations is out.\u201d The chief also said he made sure his officers received fresh training in sex crimes investigations. Proper training includes an understanding of what DNA testing can do \u2014 even when suspects claim sex was consensual. In several departments, CNN found officers failed to test kits in so-called consent cases because they believed testing would only demonstrate that sex occurred, not whether a crime occurred. That\u2019s short-sighted, experts said. A DNA profile of the suspect in a consent case could match a DNA profile of an unidentified attacker in another rape, connecting those crimes and helping to solve them both. The testing of the backlog in Wayne County, Michigan, has linked kits in \u201cconsent\u201d cases to suspects in other sexual assaults, said prosecutor Worthy. CNN also discovered cases in which police listed \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d as a reason to destroy kits that were never analyzed. Testing might have produced evidence, advancing investigations while there was still time to prosecute. Even a tested kit that fails to yield DNA evidence during an initial analysis should be preserved, forensic experts said, because testing technology is constantly improving. DNA that couldn\u2019t be detected just a few years ago can sometimes be recovered today. Nakamura memo Two police departments \u2014 Salt Lake City and West Valley \u2014 continued to destroy rape kits after Salt Lake County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Blake Nakamura said he sent them a 2011 memo ordering that evidence be maintained. Source: Salt Lake County District Attorney\u2019s Office Blake Nakamura, the chief deputy prosecutor in Utah\u2019s Salt Lake County, said he came to understand the importance of preserving evidence in sex crimes cases years ago. Nakamura has been on both sides in the courtroom. As a private defense attorney, he successfully defended a man accused of sexually abusing a child by blocking the admission of evidence. When he became a prosecutor, he wanted to be able to admit all evidence and knew he had to protect rape kits from destruction. So in 2011, he sent a memo to police departments in his county, notifying them to keep all evidence in sex offense cases. At least two failed to follow his directive: Salt Lake City and West Valley. They provided records to CNN showing they continued to destroy kits for at least a couple more years. They also provided documentation showing why: Prosecutors in Nakamura\u2019s office approved the destruction. When CNN showed those records to Nakamura, he was irate. He later spoke with his staff in colorful language he said he couldn\u2019t share. But the prosecutor feels certain they got his message.\n\nIt is particularly egregious, experts said, to destroy rape kits belonging to children, the most vulnerable victims. Young victims often can\u2019t express what happened to them, so their rape kits can speak for them. The evidence can prove abuse because suspects, unlike in adult cases, can\u2019t argue that sexual contact was consensual. Children who report being sexually assaulted should be interviewed by experts trained in dealing with young victims. Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Statutes of limitations for teenagers and children typically do not start until victims reach adulthood. \u201cIt takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\u201d said Marci Hamilton, a professor and attorney who analyzed juvenile cases for CNN to determine whether they had been destroyed before the statutes of limitations. \u201cWhat police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\u201d Hamilton and CNN identified 47 children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 rape kits that were destroyed before the statutes of limitations expired or where there was no time limit to prosecute. At least 39 were untested. CNN\u2019s analysis did not include \u201cunfounded\u201d cases, those in which police determined that no crime was attempted or occurred. But Hamilton, whose non-profit CHILD USA advocates for sexual abuse victims, argued that given the complexity of child sex abuse, juvenile reports should rarely be labeled unfounded. In Fallon, Nevada, a detective dismissed a 7-year-old\u2019s case as unfounded, partly because the child looked away from him as he questioned her in 2013. The girl described how a man had assaulted her anally, orally and vaginally the previous night, and then methodically cleansed her body. Even though the child was consistent in describing the incident to others, the detective said her body language \u2014 looking away \u2014 indicated she was being deceptive. The detective suggested to her parents that they get her psychological help. Marci Hamilton: The head of CHILD USA says children rarely report sexual abuse when it happens; when they do, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary. When they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d Melissa Golden/Redux for CNN Police destroyed the girl\u2019s untested rape kit seven months after the allegations of abuse were made. Experts said the 7-year-old\u2019s account should have raised a red flag; until children reach puberty and start to have sexual urges, they are generally incapable of imagining rape scenarios. The detective, they added, seemed to judge the child\u2019s body language as he would an adult\u2019s. The police chief in Fallon, Kevin Gehman, said the girl\u2019s account was fully investigated but acknowledged \u201csome weaknesses in the investigative process.\u201d He would not elaborate. CNN\u2019s questions about the case prompted a review of all sexual assault investigations by the police and the city attorney. As a result, the attorney instructed police to stop destroying rape kits. The statutes of limitations on sex crimes against children typically do not begin ticking until they reach legal adulthood. Melissa Golden/REDUX for CNN Hamilton and other experts said it is rare for minors to disclose abuse soon after it occurs. Out of fear or confusion \u2014 or because predators manipulate them \u2014 young victims may delay talking about what happened for years, if not decades. That\u2019s all the more reason to maintain their rape kits. When children report what happened immediately, \u201cit\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhen they have a rape kit, that\u2019s a gift.\u201d", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/destroyed-cnn-investigation-invs/index.html", "published": "2018-11-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why have police destroyed rape kits?", "text": "(CNN) In the era of #MeToo and stories about the alleged perpetrators of sexual violence, CNN's exclusive investigation \"Destroyed\" turns the spotlight on those responsible for protecting the public.\n\nAn examination into the destruction of rape kits in dozens of agencies across the country found that police trashed evidence in 400 cases before the statutes of limitations expired or when there was no time limit to prosecute.\n\nThe number is likely higher and was calculated by analyzing the departments' own records.\n\nThe destruction occurred since 2010 and followed flawed and incomplete police investigations.\n\nMost of the kits were untested, CNN found, and dozens were discarded mere weeks or months after police took custody of the evidence.\n\nJournalists long ago brought to light the failure of law enforcement agencies to send thousands of rape kits to be analyzed for DNA. That revelation ignited national outrage, prompted the passage of laws ordering the testing of rape kits and spurred the Justice Department to award more than $150 million to help analyze the backlog.\n\n\"Destroyed\" exposes a lesser-known and more fundamental problem:\n\nThe rape kits are gone. They can never be used to lock up a rapist or exonerate the wrongfully convicted.\n\nThis North Carolina woman reported being gang-raped. A detective botched her case, and her rape kit was destroyed.\n\n1. 'A systemic problem'\n\nA rape kit should be maintained for at least the length of time a crime can be prosecuted, experts told CNN.\n\nYet decisions about whether and when to destroy this evidence, CNN found, were made without considering the statutes of limitations.\n\nSome police departments defended the destruction of kits tied to closed cases that they believed had no chance of moving forward, such as when a prosecutor declined to bring a charge or when a victim who reported being raped stopped engaging with police.\n\nBut experts called that short-sighted.\n\nAnything can develop in a case while the statute of limitations is still running. New evidence can emerge or a victim may decide to work again with police, for example.\n\n\"What CNN discovered is a systemic problem,\" said retired Sergeant Joanne Archambault, who ran the San Diego Police Department's sex crimes unit for a decade.\n\n\"You're not serious about solving rape cases if you destroy rape kits before the statute of limitations [expires].\"\n\nArchambault was among the experts CNN asked to review cases that ended in kit destruction.\n\n\"There are mistakes in these cases,\" she said, \"but the worst mistake in each is the destruction of evidence.\"\n\nRape victims consent to invasive exams in the hope that the evidence gathered will bring their attackers to justice.\n\n2. The destruction of kits is a tragedy as troubling as the backlog\n\nDetroit prosecutor Kym Worthy's office has fought to test the backlog of 10,000 unanalyzed kits in Wayne County, Michigan. That effort identified at least 833 suspects linked to more than one sex crime. Testing kits can not only solve crimes, it can prevent future ones by stopping would-be repeat perpetrators before they strike again.\n\nWorthy was stunned to hear that law enforcement agencies have destroyed rape kits -- most of them never analyzed.\n\n\"All the attention toward untested kits isn't enough if we have agencies destroying kits.\"\n\nShe isn't just a prosecutor. She's a survivor. Worthy was raped in law school, she said, and -- like an estimated 68% of rape and sexual assault victims nationally -- she chose not to report her attack.\n\nIt's a triumph, she said, when a victim musters the courage to undergo an hours-long, invasive forensic examination with the hope that the DNA recovered will aid police in pursuing their assailant.\n\n\"Each one of these kits represents a victim,\" Worthy said. \"What you are doing when you destroy a rape kit is destroying the chance that they are ever going to see justice.\"\n\nExperts who examined case files for CNN found detectives improperly labeled cases \"unfounded\" \u2014 a term that means no crime occurred or was attempted.\n\n3. Destruction of rape kits followed poorly conducted investigations\n\nSeasoned police trainers, a former prosecutor, a DNA analyst and a trauma expert were among those who reviewed investigative case files in which kits were destroyed. They pointed to numerous flaws: kits were not tested, suspects were not interviewed, witnesses were not pursued. These experts taught CNN reporters, who reviewed more than 1,400 rape investigations, how to discern whether cases were conducted in a thorough and trauma-informed way.\n\nDetectives trained in how trauma affects victims know that withdrawal and avoidance are common symptoms. Best practice is to work at a pace set by the victim, connect the victim to advocacy services and offer, if needed, safety measures to protect a victim after a reported assault. It's critical to build rapport with a victim whose trust has been so severely violated, experts said. And that can only come by giving victims the time they need.\n\nBut that's not what CNN and experts saw in case after case.\n\nDetectives imposed arbitrary deadlines on victims and when they did not meet them, investigators closed cases, labeled victims \"uncooperative\" and relegated rape kits to evidence rooms until the evidence was trashed.\n\nA detective with the Springfield, Missouri, Police Department sent letters to victims, in some cases the day after they reported their assaults, warning that if they did not get in touch within 10 business days, their cases would not be investigated further.\n\n\"Victims have lost control of the most personal decision we make -- who we choose to be intimate with. They want some control back... When we send them a letter saying, 'Yeah, do this or else,'... (it) sounds very demanding, it sounds very much like what they may have experienced with the offender,\" said police trainer Tom Tremblay, a former sex crimes investigator who reviewed case files for CNN.\n\n4. The rape kits of the most vulnerable victims were destroyed\n\nIn the cases reviewed by CNN and Marci Hamilton, a law professor and attorney who is a nationally recognized expert on child sex crimes law, rape kits taken from minors who reported sexual abuse were destroyed by police while the alleged crimes could have still been prosecuted.\n\nTypically, the statute of limitations to prosecute a sex crime involving a victim who is a minor doesn't start ticking until the victim reaches legal adulthood.\n\n\"It takes years to comprehend the trauma of child sex abuse, well into adulthood, to decide whether to move forward,\" Hamilton said. \"What police do when they destroy rape kits, and other evidence of crimes against children before the statute of limitations has passed, is rob them of their full chance at justice.\"\n\nCNN found that the rape kits of children and teenagers were among those discarded while the statutes of limitations were still running.\n\nCNN highlighted several cases that underscore Hamilton's outrage, including that of a 16-year-old who told police in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that her father raped her.\n\nA state crime lab notified the detective that it found the man's sperm in the teen's rape kit . But the investigator did not pursue the man. Instead, the detective wrote that he could not find the teenager, closed the case and then authorized the destruction of the girl's rape kit. Years later, police reopened the case and arrested the father without the evidence they said tied him to the crime. What followed was more anguish for the girl -- now a woman -- and another failure for the department.\n\nIn Springfield, Missouri, police trashed a 4-year-old's rape kit and the shorts she was wearing on the day of her alleged assault -- without ever testing that evidence. The girl's mother said she saw a wet spot on her daughter's shorts, and the child disclosed to a forensic interviewer that she was touched in her genital area by her uncle. Policing and legal experts who read the case file said it was possible the wet spot was bodily fluid left by the alleged abuser.\n\nWithout testing the shorts or rape kit evidence, police took their investigation to a prosecutor, who declined to file charges. The attorney explained her decision in writing: \"Unfortunately, no corroborating evidence.\"\n\nPolice ended the case and, two years later, in 2014, destroyed the girl's rape kit and shorts. Testing both might have provided corroborating evidence, experts said.\n\n5. Why this happened and how to start to fix it\n\nIt comes down to money, training and values. Departments said they didn't have enough of the first two. And experts said the third requires a commitment by agency leaders to examine their department's investigations and ask, \"How can we do better?\"\n\nCNN began reporting this project in 2016 after the police chief in Fayetteville, North Carolina, announced at a news conference that his department had regrettably destroyed 333 rape kits.\n\nThe officer who discovered the destruction, Lieutenant John Somerindyke, said detectives had the authority to approve disposal of rape kits in their cases and did so often after conducting poor investigations.\n\nLieutenant John Somerindyke: The head of the cold case unit in Fayetteville, North Carolina, spent two years reviewing old rape files. Many cases looked as though they could have been solved, but the rape kits were gone.\n\nThe agency failed victims because officers carried caseloads that were too large, he said, and the department lacked adequate resources. And, investigators were not trained to understand how victims behave after trauma.\n\nOther departments that destroyed rape kits echoed those complaints.\n\nOne answer, experts said, is more training at agencies nationwide on trauma and on the importance of testing and preserving rape kits.\n\nThey also said departments should regularly audit sex crimes investigations, and those audits should ideally be done by professionals outside the agency.\n\nFor now, that isn't happening. But there has long been at least one exception: The Philadelphia Police Department. It began annually reviewing its sex crimes investigations with the help of the Women's Law Project in 2000 after the Philadelphia Inquirer revealed that the police had mishandled rape cases.\n\n\"It's the essence of community policing,\" said attorney Carol Tracy, director of the Philadelphia Women's Law Project.\n\nTracy reviewed rape investigations for CNN and has consulted with departments across the country grappling with their backlog of untested rape kits.\n\n\"Kits being destroyed,\" she said. \"That is something I didn't realize was happening.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/29/health/destroyed-rape-kits-takeaways-invs/index.html", "published": "2018-11-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "US life expectancy drops in 2017 due to drug overdoses, suicides", "text": "(CNN) Life expectancy in the United States declined from 2016 to 2017, yet the 10 leading causes of death remained the same, according to three government reports released Thursday. Increasing deaths due to drug overdoses and suicides explain this slight downtick in life expectancy, the US Centers for Disease Control says.\n\nOverdose deaths reached a new high in 2017, topping 70,000, while the suicide rate increased by 3.7%, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reports.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, CDC director, called the trend tragic and troubling. \"Life expectancy gives us a snapshot of the Nation's overall health and these sobering statistics are a wakeup call that we are losing too many Americans, too early and too often, to conditions that are preventable,\" he wrote in a statement.\n\nGeneral US death rates\n\nThe estimate of how long a person born in 2017 can expect to live in the United States is 78.6 years, a decrease of 0.1 year from 2016, the government statisticians say.\n\nAs usual, women will continue to outlive men. In both 2016 and 2017, female life expectancy was 81.1 years, while male life expectancy dropped from 76.2 years in 2016 to 76.1 in 2017.\n\nThe number of resident deaths recorded in the nation totaled more than 2.8 million in 2017, about 69,000 more than in 2016, the report shows. Naturally, this increase affects the overall death rate, which is annually adjusted to account for the changing age of the general population. The rate increased from nearly 729 deaths per 100,000 people in 2016 to nearly 732 deaths in 2017 -- a rise of 0.4%.\n\nMost races and ethnic groups, including black males, Hispanic males and Hispanic females, saw no significant changes in their death rate year over year.\n\nHowever, black females experienced a 0.8% decreasing death rate in 2017 over the previous year, meaning they lived a bit longer, while the rate increased by 0.6% for white males and by 0.9% for white females.\n\nFinally, the 10 leading causes of death in 2017, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all deaths across the nation, were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injuries, chronic lower respiratory diseases, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, influenza and pneumonia, kidney disease and suicide. This grim \"top 10 list\" remained unchanged from the previous year.\n\nDrug overdose deaths\n\nDrug overdose deaths among US residents totaled 70,237 in 2017, nearly 6,600 more than in 2016, a second government report finds. The rate increased from about 6 overdose deaths per 100,000 people in 1999 to nearly 22 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nRates have been consistently and significantly higher for males than females throughout the years, increasing from about 8 men dying of an overdose per 100,000 in 1999 to about 29 men per 100,000 in 2017. Among women, the rate increased from about 4 overdose deaths per 100,000 in 1999 to about 14 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nAge was an influencing factor in these deaths, the researchers found. Adults between 25 and 54 experienced the highest rates of drug overdose deaths in 2017. The 25-to-34 group had nearly 38 overdose deaths per 100,000, the 35-to-44 group had 39 per 100,000, and the 45-to-54 group had about 38 per 100,000.\n\nYounger and older people died by overdose less frequently, the report indicates. People between the ages of 15 and 24 experienced about 13 overdose deaths per 100,000, those between 55 and 64 experienced 28 per 100,000, and the 65 and older age group had about 7 deaths per 100,000.\n\nOverall, the greatest increase in drug overdose death rates was among adults between 55 and 64 for the period 1999 to 2017: About 4 deaths per 100,000 occurred in this group in 1999, compared with 28 per 100,000 in 2017.\n\nPlace also mattered when it came to drug overdose deaths, with some states registering higher numbers than others, the report shows. The 2017 rate in West Virginia was nearly 58 overdose deaths per 100,000 people, in Ohio about 46 per 100,000, in Pennsylvania about 44 per 100,000, and in the District of Columbia, 44 per 100,000. Meanwhile, Texas (about 10 drug overdose deaths per 100,000), North Dakota (about 9 per 100,000), South Dakota and Nebraska (both about 8 per 100,000) had the lowest rates in 2017.\n\nThe heroin overdose death rate remained constant at about 5 deaths per 100,000 people for both 2016 and 2017; that said, it is seven times higher than in 1999. By contrast, overdose deaths involving fentanyl, fentanyl analogs and other synthetic opioids (other than methadone) increased by 45% between 2016 and 2017, rising from about 6 deaths per 100,000 to 9 per 100,000.\n\nDeaths by suicide\n\nOver the past decade, suicide has ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, a third new final government report reveals. Though constant, the rate has increased over time from about 10 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017. And female suicides increased at a higher rate than male suicides during this period, though more men than women die by suicide each year.\n\nAmong males, the rate increased 26% between 1999 and 2017, from about 18 suicides per 100,000 to nearly 22 per 100,000.\n\nAmong females, the rate increased 53% from 4 suicides per 100,000 in 1999 to nearly 6 per 100,000 in 2017. Women between the ages of 45 and 64 experienced the highest rates in both 1999 (6 suicides per 100,000) and 2017 (nearly 10 suicides per 100,000).\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nRates in rural US counties are nearly twice as high as in urban counties, the government statisticians say.\n\nIn 1999, the suicide rate for the most rural counties was about 13 per 100,000, compared with nearly 10 per 100,000 in the most urban counties.\n\nIn 2017, the suicide rate for the most rural counties (20 per 100,000) outpaced that in the most urban counties (about 11 per 100,000). However, this 2017 urban suicide rate is 16% higher than in 1999 (about 10 per 100,000), while the 2017 suicide rate for the most rural counties is 53% higher than in 1999 (about 13 per 100,000), the report indicates.\n\n\"We must all work together to reverse this trend and help ensure that all Americans live longer and healthier,\" Redfield said in his statement, of the decline in life expectancy.

Deem also says a research interest is the \"mathematical model of evolution that accounts for cross-species genetic exchange.\"\n\nMatthews wrote in an email that she was surprised \"to find out that Professor Deem was involved in this research.\" Adding that she had only recently began working with Deem, she said she had not \"seen anything to suggest that Professor Deem's scientific work is in question,\" nor did she believe any data in co-authored paper was affected.\n\n\"Had Professor Deem informed me of his work using CRISPR on human embryos to develop a baby, I would have recommended extreme caution using this technology on human embryos and to wait for more data on risks before using manipulated embryos for pregnancies,\" Matthews wrote.\n\nDeem's past work has been funded by various governmental agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, but spokeswoman Renate Myles said Deem has not received a grant from that agency since 2014.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday , Director Dr. Francis Collins reiterated the agency's stance against gene-editing in human embryos and expressed deep concern over He's behavior:\n\n\"This work represents a deeply disturbing willingness by Dr. He and his team to flaunt international ethical norms. The project was largely carried out in secret, the medical necessity for inactivation of CCR5 in these infants is utterly unconvincing, the informed consent process appears highly questionable, and the possibility of damaging off-target effects has not been satisfactorily explored.\n\n\"Should such epic scientific misadventures proceed, a technology with enormous promise for prevention and treatment of disease will be overshadowed by justifiable public outrage, fear, and disgust.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe, who the university says was \"the son of rice farmers in Hunan Province in China,\" was lead author with Deem on a paper presenting a mathematical model that could determine within two weeks whether a new strain of the influenza virus should be included in the annual seasonal flu vaccine.

The extensive damage left him missing most of his lower jaw, his nose and every tooth but one, a statement said. He also experienced damage to his upper face and palate.\n\nConventional reconstructive surgery, which he reportedly tried several times, could only do so much.\n\nThen, Underwood's mother, Beverly Bailey-Potter, read a magazine article about Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez, a professor of reconstructive plastic surgery and the chair of the plastic surgery department at NYU Langone Health.\n\n\"We knew he was the only person to whom we would trust Cameron's life,\" she said in the release from the hospital. \"We were willing to travel the long distance.\"\n\nCameron Underwood before his injury.\n\nRead More\n\nSince the first face transplant was done in France in 2005, more than 40 have been completed around the world. NYU Langone Health has completed two of the procedures and has a designated face transplantation program, one of just a handful in the United States. Rodriguez completed two previous face transplants, the first at University of Maryland, and headed up a team of more than 100 medical professionals who tackled Underwood's case. The transplant surgery lasted about 25 hours. Cameron Underwood before his face transplant and nearly 11 months after the surgery. Underwood's journey has been marked by milestones. The time between his injury and face transplant was just about 18 months, the shortest period between the two in publicly reported cases in the United States, the hospital said. This is significant in helping his physical, emotional and psychological recovery, Rodriguez said. The 'most extensive' face transplant in history gives firefighter new life \"Cameron has not lived with his injury for a decade or longer like most other face transplant recipients have,\" Rodriguez said in the statement. \"As a result, he has not had to deal with many of the long-term psycho-social issues which often lead to issues like severe depression, substance abuse, and other potentially harmful behaviors.\" Underwood also experienced one of the shortest wait times for a donor, the hospital said. Once he was approved for a transplant by NYU Langone and put on the list for organ donation, he waited only six months for the early January call that would change his life. His donor was William Fisher, a 23-year-old resident of New York who was an aspiring filmmaker and writer. Fisher, who registered as an organ donor when he was a teen, gave to more than just Underwood. He also gave his heart, kidneys, liver, eyes and other tissues. William Fisher of New York was the face donor. In honoring her son's wishes, Fisher's heartbroken mother got something in return. \"Being a part of this experience has been a source of strength for me during a very difficult time,\" she said in the statement. \"I don't think I would have survived Will's death if not for Cameron. Cameron has his whole life ahead of him -- and I love the idea that Willie is helping him have a better life.\" Underwood was discharged from the hospital in mid-February but initially stayed in New York for rehabilitation, which included speech therapy, and orthodontic treatment.

This just manifests in different ways, she added.\n\nThe second in a series, with the first released last year , the report analyzes 41 indicators tracking the link between climate change and health in five areas: climate change impacts, resilience for health, mitigation actions, finance and public engagement.\n\nRobinson explained that there \"is a lot of variability year on year,\" but \"the trend appears to be upwards,\" indicating even more heat wave events in the future. Similarly, numbers of vulnerable people \"are going up over time.\"\n\nSome progress but far from enough\n\nThere have been some promising trends, like an increase in renewable energy, with jobs in that sector rising by 5.7% between 2016 and 2017, according to the report. But the investment in renewables \"is not yet anything like what it would need to be if we are to get to the 1.5 degrees\" -- a commitment agreed during the Paris Climate Agreement to limit average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius from pre-Industrial Revolution levels, said Paul Ekins, professor of resources and environment policy at University College London, who was involved in the report.\n\nSome positive trends were also identified in the form of coal phaseouts and cleaner, healthier transportation methods. But coal usage needs to be at 20% of 2010 usage levels by 2040 to meet targets, the report states.\n\nwho authored the American chapter of the Lancet report, said it delivers a message of hope, as action is happening, but she pointed out that \"climate change is harming the health of this country now.\" This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment Dr. Renee Salas, doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital,who authored the American chapter of the Lancet report, said it delivers a message of hope, as action is happening, but she pointed out that \"climate change is harming the health of this country now.\"This follows on from the outcome of the Fourth National Climate Assessment report published by the White House on Friday.\n\nThis year marked a record summer in many parts of the world, with much higher temperatures than most populations are used to. Watts highlighted a recent study suggesting that the 2018 heat waves across Europe were made twice as likely as a result of climate change. \"Assigning attribution for every single event is difficult, but it's clear that these sorts of events are examples of what is likely to come if we don't rapidly respond to climate change,\" he said.\n\nThe research identified that the global population was on average exposed to a temperature increase of 0.8 degrees Celsius between 1986 and 2017. The global surface temperature change for this period was 0.3 degrees Celsius. This shows that \"populations are aging, growing and migrating in to the areas worst affected by climate change,\" Watts explained.\n\nSalas said that \"We must take aggressive action to combat climate change today so that by the end of the century, we'll have saved thousands of lives each year, along with hundreds of billions of dollars in public health cost.\"\n\nSpread of diseases and fatalities\n\nSmall changes in temperature and rainfall will also help the spread of infectious diseases, the report found.\n\nFor example, the capacity of the dengue virus to spread has increased by 7.8% since the 1950s.\n\nThe seasonal capacity for the Aedes mosquito -- the primary species spreading Zika, dengue and chikungunya -- and its ability to spread have lengthened and strengthened, the report says.\n\n2016 had the most dengue transmission on record, according to the report, and the spread is expected to rise in line with greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nKristie Ebi, a professor of global health at the University of Washington who also was involved in the report, said the geographic spread of the mosquito that can carry dengue, Zika and chikunguya has increased \"dramatically with higher temperatures.\" She added that the researchers don't see the impacts individually but stressed the wide-ranging effects of climate change.\n\nLevels of global cholera bacteria are also worrying. An increasing trend of rising suitability to Vibrio, the bacteria that can cause cholera and some other illnesses, has been observed globally. The United States witnessed a 27% increase in coastline areas that are suitable for Vibrio infections between the 1980s and 2010s.\n\nWe \"can not ignore these challenges we are seeing,\" said Gina McCarthy, director of the Center for Climate, Health and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who was not involved in report. She cited the California wildfires and the rise in vector-borne diseases.\n\nDeaths from pollution\n\nA \"lack of progress\" in reducing emissions continues to endanger lives and public health care systems, according to the researchers.\n\nEurope was the region with most premature deaths from ambient air pollution in the form of PM 2.5 -- particulates smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter -- in 2015, followed by the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia, the report found.\n\nParticulate matter can settle in airways and cause problems like cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions and cancers, leading to premature death, according to the World Health Organization\n\nPaul Ekins, a professor of resources and environment policy at University College London who was involved in the report, stressed that \"any notion we may have that somehow in Europe, we are kind of doing better than other regions should be displaced.\"\n\nReduced productivity\n\nExtreme heat as a result of climate change cost the world 153 billion hours of work last year, the report found.\n\nIn China alone, 21 billion hours of work were lost to extreme heat in 2017, equal to 1.4% of the country's working population. Robinson said that rising temperatures have \"a direct impact on labor.\"\n\nThe majority of labor hours losses occurred in more vulnerable regions such as India, southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and South America.\n\nAfter decades of global improvement in food security, the report shows that crop yields are falling in 30 countries, including Cuba, the UAE and Luxembourg.\n\nIn some countries, the difference between the actual crop yield achieved and the maximum crop yield proves that negative impacts of climate change cancel out technological improvements, according to a 2011 study , published in the Nature international journal of science.\n\nAre we able to cope?\n\nWatts warned that the report shows over half -- 51% -- of 478 global cities surveyed stated that their public health infrastructure will be seriously compromised by climate change, by overwhelming services with new health threats or from extreme weather events directly threatening health services.\n\nThis means \"systemic failure,\" Watts said, like the shutdown of a hospital.\n\nGlobal spending on climate adaptation for health is at 4.8% -- too little to keep in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, the researchers say.\n\nEurope and Southeast Asia are the biggest spenders, with low-income countries' funding too little to meet their needs, according to the report.\n\nThe report has upped the stakes for faster progress, Ekins said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe believes that the findings represent a \"worse outlook, because we weren't moving fast enough for 2 degrees,\" as agreed in the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Conference, \"and we're definitely not moving fast enough for 1.5\" degrees.\n\nWatts noted that the Lancet Countdown report is not able to say in which direction the world is heading, but \"whichever way we go, it ends up shaping the health profile of countries for the next century.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/health/global-climate-change-and-health-report-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Mother sues US for $60 million after toddler detained at immigration facility later died", "text": "(CNN) A mother whose toddler died weeks after they were released from a Texas immigrant detention center has filed a wrongful death claim seeking $60 million from the US government.\n\nYazmin Juarez's 19-month-old daughter, Mariee, died in May, six weeks after they were released from the immigration facility in Dilley.\n\nJuarez and her attorney allege that ICE and those running the facility provided substandard medical care for the toddler after she suffered a respiratory infection while in detention.\n\nYazmin Juarez and Mariee were detained by ICE in March.\n\n\"The US government had a duty to provide this little girl with safe, sanitary living conditions and proper medical care but they failed to do that resulting in tragic consequences,\" attorney R.

While there are a few different compounds that can be used for the purpose, the overwhelmingly common compound is called chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile, or \"CS.\" Tear gas is often assumed to be an irritant, like the fumes of an onion in the eyes or pepper in the nose. Recent medical research has proven otherwise, says Sven Eric Jordt, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Duke University who specializes in sensory mechanisms \"We discovered that the chemical causes pain by activating pain receptors,\" Jordt says. I would consider them to be nerve agents that selectively and very potently engage pain nerves.\" JUST WATCHED Border commissioner: Only 1 kind of tear gas Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Border commissioner: Only 1 kind of tear gas 01:11 Children are especially vulnerable to its effects The Centers for Disease Control says tear gas can cause blurred vision, burning and swelling in the nose, coughing, choking, shortness of breath and skin burns, in addition to other side effects. According to the CDC, most of these effects go away after 15 to 30 minutes -- if the person is decontaminated. That's a key step, because Jordt points out that tear gas isn't a gas at all, but rather a solid; a powder that has to be heated and mixed with a solvent. \"That's why they can deposit on the skin, hair, eyes and clothing,\" he says. \"If [people] are not decontaminated, this can cause injuries.\" Children are at an even higher risk for injuries -- both at the time of exposure and later on. \"Children are especially at risk because tear gas is heavier than air,\" says Jordt. \"It is present in higher concentrations closer to the ground, and children, being shorter, are exposed to higher concentrations. Also, since their lungs are smaller, when they inhale tear gas the potential for injury is higher.\" A migrant girl from Honduras, part of a caravan of thousands traveling from Central America en route to the United States, cries after running away from tear gas thrown by the US border control near the border wall between the US and Mexico in Tijuana, Mexico. It affects their long term health These reasons were echoed in a statement by the American Academy of Pediatrics condemning the use of tear gas on migrant families. \"The use of tear gas on children -- including infants and toddlers in diapers -- goes against evidence-based recommendations, and threatens their short and long-term health,\" the statement, written by AAP President Colleen A. Kraft, reads. \"Children are uniquely vulnerable to physiological effects of chemical agents. A child's smaller size, more frequent number of breaths per minute and limited cardiovascular stress response compared to adults magnifies the harm of agents such as tear gas.\" The AAP also alludes to possible psychological trauma, since children who have arrived at the border \"have taken harrowing journeys.\" \"We must make every effort not to retraumatize them,\" Kraft writes.

In 2012, researchers observed the health of US Army recruits during the riot control portion of their basic training .

MacGregor, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the San Francisco School of Medicine, said in the lawsuit. \"Mr. Shields had no known cardiac disease. Within 15 minutes of learning of the impending missile attack, Mr. Shields had developed symptoms of an acute myocardial infraction. Shortly after that, he experienced a cardiac arrest.\" By the time Shields and Reichel had reached the hospital, the state had already sent out a second message to phones in Hawaii 38 minutes after the initial alert saying it was a false alarm.

To stay on a relatively even keel, Ramsey and his older brother Bodi \u2014 also autistic \u2014 take a daily battery of mood stabilizers, sleep aides, and anticonvulsants, with long-term negative side effects that can range from hormonal storms to fatty liver.\n\n\"Every day you have to open up your cabinet and see something called 'amphetamines' and give them to your child,\" says their mother, Katelyn Castleberry, looking at a shelf full of pill bottles. \"The shock never wears off.\"\n\nCastleberry wants to do everything she can to help her boys have normal childhoods. But there's one promising remedy she hasn't been able to try: marijuana.\n\nUnlike in most states, it's technically legal for use as a therapy for autistic children in Louisiana. It's just not available yet, and because of the thicket of rules the state legislature imposed to keep marijuana as medical as possible, Castleberry worries it never will be.\n\nRamsey Castleberry, 8, is on the autism spectrum. His mother Katelyn thinks he may benefit from medical marijuana, but it's not available in Louisiana yet.\n\nAs state after state across America has moved to legalize marijuana for recreational as well as medical use \u2014 or medical use with such liberal rules that almost anyone qualifies \u2014 conservative Louisiana set out to make sure it's used only for the conditions spelled out in its laws, and for research in a tightly controlled setting.\n\nCurrently, 33 states and the District of Columbia have some kind of medical marijuana access law, though not all of them have set up programs to implement them yet. If Louisiana succeeds, it could light the way for other conservative states that want marijuana's therapeutic benefits \u2014 especially as a relatively non-addictive alternative to the opioids that have wreaked such havoc in communities across the country \u2014 but don't want adults getting high just for fun.\n\nIn an effort to keep tight control over the marijuana industry, Louisiana has limited production to just two state universities, which makes the supply chain highly vulnerable to disruptions. Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, says that in itself sets the program up for failure.\n\n\"Louisiana seems to be an example of how to over regulate the product,\" Armentano says. \"The program is not in the best interests of many of the patients it's designed to serve.\"\n\nDo I stay in the place I love with my family and make where I live a better place? Or do I go to a place that will allow my sons to live?\" Katelyn Castleberry, mother of two autistic boys\n\nWashington isn't helping matters. The Department of Justice in January rescinded an Obama-era policy that had eased the enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states where use had been deemed legal. Once again, federal prosecutors can decide how to go after people for the possession, sale or cultivation of marijuana. With cannabis still considered a Schedule 1 substance, the federal government also rarely funds research on it, the Food and Drug Administration won't approve most drugs derived from it, and hospitals fear losing federal dollars if they even let it in the door.\n\nOther potential pitfalls for the program include limitations on the forms and potency the medication can take to a lack of clarity on whether physicians who recommend the drug will be punished for doing so. Because of testing and inspection delays, the first vials of tetrahydrocannabinol solution, or THC, that are approved for medical use won't be on shelves until late January, and even then will be limited to the highest-need patients until more supply is available.\n\nEvery once in a while, Castleberry thinks about moving to one of the seven states where parents can currently get medical marijuana for their autistic children. Instead, she's been devoting her spare time to advocating for broadening access to the drug in Louisiana. But it's a wrenching choice.\n\n\"Do I stay in the place I love with my family and make where I live a better place?\" she asks. \"Or do I go to a place that will allow my sons to live?\"\n\nA long slog toward making medicine\n\nTechnically, some Louisiana patients have been legally entitled to marijuana for decades.\n\nThe state first allowed cannabis back in 1978 for use by glaucoma and cancer patients. In 1991, they added spastic quadriplegia, a form of cerebral palsy. But the health department never set a system for production and distribution, mired in deep misgivings about a drug that meanwhile had sent thousands to prison.\n\nThat finally changed with the Alison Neustrom Act of 2015, named after a 42-year-old pancreatic cancer patient who made legalization her dying wish.\n\nAt the time, other states were designing their rules such that a diagnosis for back pain or trouble sleeping could get you virtually any type of cannabis in any amount from a shop down the street. Fred Mills, the Republican pharmacist who designed the new law, initially favored a more free-market system. But he soon learned that he'd have to go the other direction.\n\n\"I could tell that the law enforcement community was so against the bill that I had to make it a lot more conservative,\" says Mills. \"It was worth it to at least see the program develop.\"\n\nTo do that, Louisiana came up with something unique: It granted a total monopoly over marijuana production to two public universities, Louisiana State University and Southern University, an historically black college in Baton Rouge. Both of them contracted with private companies to build and operate grow facilities, in partnership with academic researchers who would study the plants.\n\nIn theory, that puts Louisiana \u2014 and the two companies with exclusive licenses \u2014 in an excellent position to develop a repository of proprietary therapeutic compounds that could prove lucrative if the drug were ever legalized on a national level.\n\n\"Everyone from the United States is going to come to us to get these genetics,\" says John Davis, president of the Louisiana division of GB Sciences, the Las Vegas-based company that won LSU's contract.\n\nLSU is already very good at working with plants. Its agriculture department has for decades done research on cash crops like rice and sweet potatoes, and reaped financial rewards from licensing patents they obtained for different strains.\n\nThat income is especially important after a decade of state budget cuts slashed funding for higher education in half. So when the prospect of doing the same thing for marijuana came up at the legislature, LSU jumped at the chance.\n\n\"That's where we see the benefit to the university long-term,\" says Ashley Mullens, LSU's coordinator for the marijuana program. \"That's why we decided to take this chance.\"\n\nAgricultural research on rice, however, is a lot different from weed. For one thing, federal rules require all marijuana for research to come from a facility at the University of Mississippi , which since 1968 has had a sole-source contract with federal drug regulators to produce it. But researchers have long complained that it's low-quality and doesn't represent the varieties now available commercially.\n\nThat's why Louisiana's program carries such promise \u2014 but also risk. They're working around the prohibition, resting on assurances from federal prosecutors that state-sanctioned marijuana programs are not on their list of priorities. \"We're committed to operating under regulations established by state statutes,\" says Hampton Grunewald, LSU AgCenter's associate vice president for government relations.\n\nA tour takes place in one of GB Science's Baton Rouge grow rooms.\n\nBecause of elaborate security requirements imposed by regulators, the grow facility in an industrial park in South Baton Rouge looks like a cross between a biopharmaceutical lab and a prison.\n\nAlong with the usual glass-walled rooms and whiteboards of a scientific research facility, there's also a wall of televisions with feeds covering every inch of the building, a room in between the front door and the entrance that will catch any intruder, key card access to every room, and security guards on site 24/7.\n\nThe plants themselves are grown on long tables in individually climate-controlled rooms, in a special nutrient mixture, irrigated with water that's been fed through a reverse osmosis system to remove any impurities. Any visitors will wear full-body Tyvek suits In order to keep them sterile and free of contaminants. The goal: Make them as uniform as possible, to create compounds that are exactly the same every time.\n\n\"Our approach has been to capture different varieties of cannabis and grow them in a way that any time you go to a pharmacy, it's identical,\" says Andrea Small-Howard, GB Sciences' chief science officer. \"It's like you go to a pharmacy and pick up Advil or Tylenol or Aleve.\"\n\nBut that costs money. Lots of money.\n\nGB Sciences, which is a public company with shares that are traded over the counter, made big promises: Investing $6.5 million in a grow facility, providing at least half a million dollars in research funding annually, and cutting the university in on 10% of its gross revenues, which with an estimated market of 60,000 to 100,000 eligible patients, could be substantial. Proceeds from any intellectual property that comes out of the partnership will be split 50-50.\n\nIf there is only one producer, how much availability will we have for patients? And at what cost?\" Kevin Caldwell, president of CommonsenseNOLA\n\nGB Sciences' own future depends on that bet paying off. Although the company has been producing cannabis products for the recreational market in Nevada to generate revenue, it posted a net loss of $23 million in fiscal year 2018 , and has been saying publicly that a successful patent could make it into a multi-billion dollar business.\n\nWinning the LSU contract was a big boost to GB Sciences' credibility, and it gives them something few if any U.S.-based cannabis companies have at this point: The ability to do research in partnership with a university on marijuana grown in-house, rather than on the stuff that comes from Ole Miss.\n\nBut unless and until those patents are granted, the medicine GB Sciences produces in Louisiana will have to start paying for itself \u2014 and the prolonged rollout has created huge pressures on the company to keep it affordable, especially since insurance doesn't cover marijuana products and patients will have to pay out of pocket. Davis declined to provide pricing information, saying that it is a \"very sensitive issue in this biopharmaceutical industry,\" and promised that the cost would be on par with other states.\n\nBut that's only wholesale. The nine licensed pharmacy operators also have to recoup millions of dollars spent going through the arduous application process and building whole new buildings to house their marijuana operations. They have almost as much mandated security as the grow facilities, including a safe for cash that must be bolted to the ground.\n\n\"The pharmacy will have no choice but to double the price,\" says Randy Mire, a pharmacist who won the license for the Baton Rouge area.\n\nA GB Sciences employee inspects plants at the company's Baton Rouge grow facility.\n\nTo make matters worse, the one institution that's supposed to provide a check on GB Sciences' pricing power \u2014 Southern University \u2014 has lagged far behind schedule.\n\nThe school awarded its contract to a brand-new company called Advanced Biomedics, funded by a local racehorse trainer named Carol Castille who promised to invest between $6 million and $10 million in the new facility. But a legal dispute between him and an investor delayed the start of the program by months, and the company never actually hired the experienced team of researchers they had originally advertised.\n\nIn November, another company bought out Advanced Biomedics, meaning that the program will essentially start from scratch.\n\nAll of this has patients and their advocates worried that the supply of marijuana could be interrupted if GB Sciences has manufacturing problems or goes bankrupt, and in any case might be prohibitively expensive for all but the very wealthy, while the poor are forced out on to the vibrant but unregulated black market.\n\n\"If there is only one producer, how much availability will we have for patients?\" asks Kevin Caldwell, president of CommonsenseNOLA, a group that advocates for marijuana legalization. \"And at what cost?\"\n\nWho will prescribe it?\n\nEven if you get the marijuana supply flowing, someone has to prescribe it. And in Louisiana, that's proving to be another bottleneck.\n\nOther states have shielded physicians by allowing them to essentially write blank prescriptions saying that the patient has a qualifying condition under state law, leaving the dosage up to the pharmacist or the patient, and no physicians have yet been prosecuted for doing so. But Louisiana wanted to keep that control over dosing in the hands of the physicians, which leaves them potentially more vulnerable to legal scrutiny.\n\nTo make matters even more perilous for the half of the state's doctors who work for hospitals, most of their employers have not taken a stand on whether it's ok to prescribe marijuana, for use inside or outside the hospital. Ochsner Health System, for example, said only that the issue was \"extremely complex.\"\n\n\"In the interest of our patients and providers, Ochsner Health System is carefully considering all of the factors and continues to monitor discussions as more information becomes available,\" it said in a statement.\n\nPhysicians have to do an online course to get certified to prescribe marijuana, and to date, only 68 physicians in the entire state have done so. The state's medical community hasn't exactly been encouraging: The Louisiana State Medical Society didn't support the 2015 legislation, citing a \"lack of science-based evidence that shows it's an effective treatment option, or safe, for patients.\"\n\nThere is substantial evidence on certain conditions like chronic pain, spasticity and multiple sclerosis, according to a comprehensive 2017 overview by the National Academies. The pace of research has accelerated in recent years, a review published in the journal Population Health Management found, with an increase in research on children and the elderly over the past five years.\n\nJohn Vanchiere, a Shreveport physician who is the president of the state's chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, remains skeptical of the entire project. He advocated for a requirement that doctors writing marijuana recommendations for autistic children consult with a pediatric sub-specialist, creating an additional barrier to access that regulators are still working to fully define.\n\n\"Why would a physician wade into those waters with what the legislature believes will be helpful to children, based on compelling stories?\" Vanchiere says. \"I'd be surprised if many general pediatricians decide to take this on.\"\n\nShreveport pharmacist Doug Boudreaux owns one of the nine licenses granted to marijuana dispensaries in Louisiana.\n\nTo get around the hospital problem, some physicians are forming their own marijuana-specific practices. Kathryn Thomas had built a chain of opioid addiction treatment clinics, which she sold in 2017 . When the marijuana option opened up in Louisiana, she decided to open a new type of treatment clinic for people seeking therapeutic marijuana.\n\nThomas then found five mostly young doctors employed at other hospitals who wanted to start the practice as a side job, and plans to contract with others. She already has a well-appointed office in Shreveport, with plans to expand to New Orleans as soon as product is available, and 3,000 people who have pre-registered on her website. Many of these people wouldn't be comfortable asking their primary care physicians for marijuana, she says.\n\n\"At least when you're coming here, we hope to decrease the stigma, and provide compassionate, respectful care,\" Thomas says.\n\nAnother group that depends on physicians stepping up to write recommendations: The nine pharmacists who'll be dispensing all of the state's marijuana. They're not allowed to advertise the product, even so much as creating a Facebook group or a website, so they'll need doctor referrals.\n\nDoug Boudreaux is a third-generation pharmacist in Shreveport who decided to pursue a license because of the hospice patients with pain and nausea that no medication has managed to fix. \"Imagine throwing up so much that you throw up fecal matter,\" he says.\n\nAfter spending $200,000 on the application process, he poured another $800,000 into a new pharmacy right across the street from Shreveport's major hospital cluster. He thinks he can break even within a few years, as long as the number of doctors licensed to recommend marijuana keeps rising.\n\n\"It's a slow process for them,\" Boudreaux says. \"But it is going up.\"\n\nHow much control is too much?\n\nEvery state that decides to legalize marijuana in any form is making things up as they go along. So in some ways, Louisiana isn't unusual.\n\nBut currently, without the normal support system around other medicines \u2014 big pharmaceutical companies and federal funding to develop drugs, hospitals to administer them, and insurance companies to pay for them \u2014 the economics of going an exclusively medical route aren't great.\n\nThat's partly why so many states end up legalizing marijuana for recreational use as well. Once that happens, most of the money flows into products that might have some therapeutic effect, but aren't up to the standards of treating specific diseases. In states like California and Colorado, for example, medical and recreational products aren't that different.\n\n\"I think Louisiana has a chance to do something I would really appreciate,\" says Jacob Irving, a pro-marijuana activist who suffers from spastic quadriplegia. \"Which is to have a robust medical system that is so different from a recreational system that the two industries would be able to survive if the state ever does go down that route.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAll of this could change, of course, if Congress were to legalize medical marijuana on a national level \u2014 a possibility that became slightly less remote with the new Democratic majority in the House and the recent departure of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had taken a hardline stance toward the drug.\n\nAndrew Freedman ran Colorado's marijuana program until last year, and now consults with governments setting up their own systems. He thinks Louisiana's approach could work, but it would help if the federal government opened up the market for investment in marijuana research, both public and private.\n\n\"I do think that they can be a leader of making medical marijuana medical,\" he says. \"The truth is, without massive resources behind it, we can't get the medical research anyway.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/health/louisiana-medical-marijuana/index.html", "published": "2018-11-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Does your gut need probiotics after antibiotics?", "text": "If you take antibiotics, there's a good chance you'll also get diarrhea.\n\nAntibiotics kill harmful bacteria that cause disease. But they also cause collateral damage to the microbiome, the complex community of bacteria that live in our gut. This results in a profound, though usually temporary, depletion of the beneficial bacteria.\n\nOne popular strategy to mitigate the disruption is to take a probiotic supplement containing live bacteria during, or following, a course of antibiotics.\n\nThe logic is simple: beneficial bacterial in the gut are damaged by antibiotics. So why not replace them with the \"beneficial\" bacterial strains in probiotics to assist gut bacteria returning to a \"balanced\" state?\n\nBut the answer is more complicated.\n\nThere is currently some evidence that taking probiotics can prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea. This effect is relatively small, with 13 people needing to take probiotics for one episode of diarrhea to be averted.\n\nBut these studies have often neglected to evaluate potential harms of probiotic use and haven't looked at their impact on the wider gut microbiome.\n\nPros and cons of probiotics\n\nThe assumption that there is little downside to taking probiotics was challenged in a recent Israeli study\n\nThe participants were given antibiotics and split into two groups: the first group was given an 11-strain probiotic preparation for four weeks; the second was given a placebo, or dummy pill.\n\nThe researchers found the antibiotic damage to the gut bacteria of those in the first group allowed the probiotic strains to effectively colonise the gut. But this colonization delayed the normal recovery of the microbiota, which remained perturbed for the entire six month study period.\n\nIn contrast, the microbiota of the second group returned to normal within three weeks of finishing antibiotics.\n\nThis research exposes a perhaps unexpected truth: we still don't know what types of bacteria are truly beneficial or even what constitutes a healthy microbiome.\n\nThe answer is unlikely to be that individual bacterial strains are particularly helpful.\n\nIt's more likely a diverse community of thousands of different types of microbes working together can provide health benefits. This microbial community is as individual as each one of us, meaning there is not just one configuration that will result in health or illness.\n\nSo, it's unlikely that the addition of one or even 11 strains of bacteria in a probiotic could somehow balance this complex system.\n\nA more effective (but less palatable) alternative?\n\nThe Israeli study also explored an alternative approach to microbiome restoration.\n\nOne group of participants had their own stool collected and frozen prior to antibiotic treatment. It was then re-instilled into their gut at the end of the antibiotic therapy.\n\nThis treatment, known as autologous fecal transplantation, was able to restore the microbiome to original levels after just eight days. The other group took 21 days to recover.\n\nThis approach has also been shown to effectively restore the gut microbiome following combined antibiotic and chemotherapy treatment. These patients are predictably at risk of serious complications, such as bloodstream infection, as a result of microbiome disruption.\n\nResearch currently underway will help us understand whether microbiome restoration with autologous fecal transplantation will translate into tangible benefits for these patients.\n\nBut such an approach would not be a realistic option for most people.\n\nFeed the good bacteria\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nA more practical strategy to aid recovery is to provide the good bacteria in your gut with their preferred source of nutrition: fiber. Fibrous compounds pass undigested through the small intestine and into the colon, where they act as fuel for bacterial fermentation.\n\nSo if you're taking antibiotics or have recently finished a course, make sure you eat plenty of vegetables, fruit and whole grains.

Gostin, a professor and faculty director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown Law, and his co-authors in an editorial published online Thursday in the medical journal JAMA.\n\nSeeing \"gaps in the response,\" Gostin and his co-authors recommend that the United States and allies \"mobilize high-level political attention and resources for the Ebola response\" and \"develop a plan to deploy public health personnel to North Kivu.\"\n\nIn October, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel who had been stationed in Congo had been pulled back from the worst affected areas due to safety concerns, a US government official familiar with the situation said at the time\n\nNot only is North Kivu experiencing spread of deadly Ebola, but long-term conflict smolders there, with 50 armed groups causing intermittent violence, according to WHO.\n\nA senior White House official confirmed this month that US government personnel who had been working on the ground in Beni had been evacuated to other parts of Congo due to safety concerns. The official said that the situation is being evaluated constantly and that in the meantime, the US continues to provide technical and financial assistance to contain the outbreak.\n\nJasarevic described the overall environment as \"complex and challenging.\"\n\n\"On Friday, 16 November, a second attack in one week occurred in Beni,\" he reported. \"UN peacekeepers and government forces engaged with rebel forces. By Sunday, November 18 all activities in Beni were re-launched, including vaccination.\"\n\nJasarevic says the response in areas outside Beni has not been affected by conflict, but WHO estimates that more than a million refugees and internally displaced people are traveling through and out of North Kivu and Ituri, and this movement is a potential risk factor for the spread of Ebola.\n\nDespite such risks and safety concerns, Congo's response effort has been robust. The Ministry of Health has 900 people active in the response, according to Jasarevic, and of these, 85% are from the local area. Additionally, WHO has deployed 300 of its own staff to the region.\n\nThe latest minstry report indicates that 37,559 people have received an experimental vaccine in a campaign that began August 8. \"This includes over 11,100 health and frontline workers, and 9,300 children,\" Jasarevic said.\n\nThe experimental rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, made by pharmaceutical company Merck, proved highly protective against the deadly virus in a major trial in Guinea, according to WHO.\n\nGostin and his co-authors are doubtful. \"Despite deploying an experimental vaccine, cases doubled in October 2018,\" they wrote. More generally, they believe that the overall response, which also includes contact tracing and investigational treatments, may not be adequate.\n\n'Cascading transmission' of the disease\n\n\"Of 137 confirmed cases between October 28 and November 26, only 19 were found through contact tracing, 32 were on contact lists but lost to follow-up, and 83 (61%) had no known links to confirmed cases,\" Gostin and his co-authors wrote. \"These data suggest contact tracing and vaccination have not prevented cascading transmission.\"\n\nGostin also believes that \"community distrust is deep after decades-long humanitarian crises, impeding information-sharing and cooperation.\" They note that WHO and UN pledged enhanced security operations this month, \"yet lethal attacks have persisted.\"\n\nNora Love, field director for the International Rescue Committee's operations in the region, offers a more nuanced view.\n\nFrom mid-September through the end of last week, the nonprofit humanitarian group has trained over 730 health care workers who staff the dozens of health care facilities between the group's two field offices in Beni and Butembo.\n\n\"It's a very lush green area that rains every day, and the temperatures are pretty nice, but it's definitely a city at the edge of a country, and you can see that it also has been under conflict. There's definitely a tension within the communities here,\" Love said. \"You know that you're in a conflict area. There's always some sort of insecurity happening every single day.\"\n\nDespite this, she does not feel \"unwelcome here from the community,\" she said, and she does not feel under threat because she works within health facilities, \"which are a little bit more isolated than going to a village.\"\n\nGetting ahead of an infectious disease\n\n\"The people who are doing the safe burials have been the most exposed and the most vulnerable because people are very emotional after they lost a loved one,\" Love said. \"And the protocols for safe burial are different than the traditional burials here, and that causes some distress within the community.\"\n\nTraditional burials involve touching the body of the deceased. To prevent spread of the infectious disease, safe burials require protective equipment and sanitizing the family's environment.\n\nStill, Love has witnessed \"violent reactions\" at hospitals and health facilities when deaths occur. Patients have been forcefully removed from the hospital by their loved ones, she said.\n\n\"Last week, they went to a hospital when somebody died, and they did vandalism and burned some things,\" Love said. \"Luckily, so far, no health workers have been harmed by this, but there's always a watching and being aware that it could flare up.\"\n\nViolence is not the only challenge, as Beni has recently experienced a \"significant increase\" in the number of malaria cases, according to a recent report from the Ministry of Health.\n\nLove's main frustration has been the difficulty of getting \"ahead of things.

An emergency committee of the World Health Organization unanimously agreed Friday to continue to designate the paralyzing disease a \" Public Health Emergency of International Concern .\" WHO originally designated polio in this way in 2014, deeming it a health threat serious enough to endanger communities worldwide.\n\nThis year, WHO has recorded 27 cases of wild poliovirus worldwide, compared with 22 total cases last year. Though the small number of cases may appear insignificant, the committee said the trend is noteworthy because it shows stagnation.\n\nThe Global Polio Eradication Initiative , a partnership of WHO, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was initiated 30 years ago. In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries and sickened 350,000 children annually, but as a result of the public-private initiative, polio is now endemic in just three nations -- Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan -- while total cases have dropped more than 99% , according to WHO.\n\nOn Friday, the WHO emergency committee praised the \"continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan,\" yet it noted that the number of wild polio cases in Afghanistan has almost doubled in 2018, with 19 cases reported this year, compared with 10 at the same time last year. In Pakistan, the 2018 polio situation is stagnant compared with last year, while in Nigeria, more than two years have passed since the last case of poliovirus was detected, the committee noted.\n\nIn 2016, Nigeria reported a case of wild poliovirus after two years with none; WHO committee members did not speculate when the nation, which recorded 27 cases of vaccine-derived polio this year, would be declared free of the disease.\n\nAdditionally, outbreaks of various strains of vaccine-derived polio in Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Papua New Guinea and Somalia continue to be of \"major concern,\" the committee said, given that these viruses have rarely spread across borders.\n\nVaccine-derived polio occurs when the weakened vaccine virus in the oral polio vaccine is excreted and then spreads in the community, according to WHO.

It's something I make room for in my own daily life and believe others should, too.\n\nThis concept of eating your favorite treats while on a weight loss plan is often referred to as \"cheat meals.\" But personally, I would never think of eating your favorite foods with planned indulgences as \"cheating\" on your diet. I'm not alone.\n\n\"I don't like to use the word 'cheat meal' because I think it connotes that there are good and bad foods,\" said Martha McKittrick, a registered dietitian and health and wellness coach. \"You think if you are 'cheating,' you are eating a bad food, and it sets up a mind game.\"\n\n\"Cheat meals are an indication of not being happy with your diet,\" added Mascha Davis, a registered dietitian in private practice and national media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nChanging the word \"cheat\" to \"treat\" can make all the difference in the way foods are perceived and can prevent the potential for disordered eating, according to experts. But whether you call them \"treats,\" \"splurges\" or something in between, most agree that there are positive aspects of including them in your diet.\n\nThe benefits of planned indulgences\n\nIncorporating planned indulgences helps to give people something to look forward to, especially when following a stringent weight loss plan. And whether it's a piece of cake, a scoop of ice cream or a big juicy cheeseburger, scheduled splurges can also break up the monotony of restrictive eating, which can help you stick to your plan for the long-term.\n\n\"People who treat themselves are giving themselves permission to eat something they enjoy. ... It's not 'off' the plan or 'bad,' \" McKittrick said.\n\nOn the flipside, forgoing your favorite foods on a regular basis could lead to bingeing on them when you run into, say, a platter of doughnuts or a buffet table lined with fried foods and desserts.\n\nDavis recommends including portion-controlled treats every day, like a piece of dark chocolate after dinner, a small portion of chocolate-covered nuts, a small oatmeal cookie, roasted chickpeas or air-popped popcorn.\n\n\"If you love what you eat, you will be able to keep the weight off long-term, and you don't need to cheat!\" Davis said.\n\nBut changing up a weight loss plan by incorporating whatever it is you desire to eat doesn't work for everyone. \"I'll say to clients, 'do you want to have one meal a week that you can enjoy and not have to worry about being on the plan?' A lot of my clients want it, but others don't want to go there. ... They just want to stick to the plan,\" McKittrick said.\n\n\"If you are really restrictive, on a 1,200-calorie diet, and you want to eat a little bit of your favorite meal, it's hard to stop,\" said David Levitsky, professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University.\n\nIn some cases, including even a small treat on a daily basis could trigger overeating. \"If someone could have a forkful of dessert every night, that's fine, but for others, I honestly believe it sets them off,\" McKittrick said.\n\n\"I have tons of patients who can have a small amount of dark chocolate every day, but if I had box of chocolate in front of me, I couldn't have just one. Everyone is different, and you have to know your own body.\"\n\nConsiderations for treat meals\n\nThe decision to include treat meals, as well as how often and what to eat, can vary from person to person. If you decide to incorporate treat meals into your eating plan, here are some considerations to keep in mind:\n\nLose the guilt\n\nFeeling bad or guilty about indulging not only denies you pleasure, it can lead to emotionally driven eating, which can lead to weight gain and set you up for a poor relationship with food.\n\nThink about it this way: A single treat or meal will not derail your diet, but your response to eating the treat can cause you to lose control and fall off the wagon.\n\n\"Guilt will eventually bring you down. ... It can snowball into a negative conversation in your head. ... You beat yourself up and say, 'why did I do that?' And then you say, 'now I might as well eat all of this' ... and all of this erodes at your self-esteem,\" McKittrick said.\n\nConsider the timing\n\nFor some people, starting a diet plan by incorporating a daily or weekly treat meal makes sense. But others would rather hold off until an initial goal is reached.\n\n\"One guy I counseled lost 80 pounds. ... He's been on a fairly rigid plan -- mostly fruit, protein and vegetables -- but this is what he wanted. Now he's excited about taking one day a week to have three pieces of pizza or whatever he desires ... and he's excited about it and looking forward to it,\" McKittrick said.\n\nDon't turn a 'cheat' snack or meal into a 'cheat' day\n\n\"There's nothing magical about 'cheating,' \" Levitsky said. \"If you think you are getting away with something and you can 'cheat' more frequently, the rate of weight loss will go down.\"\n\nOne of McKittrick's patients gave himself an entire day to splurge. \"He was super-rigid all week long, but on Sundays, he ate nonstop for the whole day.\" Though he lost some weight initially, his weight loss came to a halt, because his strict days were simply making up for his Sunday binge. \"We changed it to one treat meal ... and now he's losing a steady 2 pounds a week.\"\n\nBe true to your indulgences\n\nIt's important to choose foods you really enjoy. That means a cheeseburger made with lean sirloin and one slice of cheese on a small whole-wheat bun might not cut it if you're really craving Shake Shack. Similarly, fruit would probably not satisfy you if you really want ice cream or a piece of candy.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIn addition to knowing what treat meals are worth incorporating into your plan, it's important to know how much of that treat will work for you. For one person, a treat meal might be eating a big bowl of pasta at their favorite restaurant one night per week, whereas someone else could be happy with a couple of forkfuls of their spouse's pasta each night, McKittrick explained.\n\nTry making your favorite foods healthier\n\nExperts say that although you shouldn't shortchange yourself when it comes to eating what you crave, you can still try to make it more nutritionally valuable.\n\n\"Pizza can be made healthier if you order a whole-grain crust, add a lot of veggies and order half the cheese. And ice cream can be a better choice if you get a sorbet or eat a healthy meal and then enjoy some real ice cream for dessert,\" Davis said. \"There is a better version of almost any 'cheat meal.' \"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/health/diet-cheat-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "You have two ages, chronological and biological.

She clicks the red cap back onto the dry erase marker and steps back to admire her work.\n\nIn front of her, the equation stretches across multiple lines, taking up much of the surface. This algorithm represents a new way of thinking about age.\n\n\"In my lab, we work on a lot of different types of aging measures,\" Levine said. \"One of the most recent ones is based on blood measures you get at your normal doctor's appointment. We basically take those and combine them using different algorithms to get what we call someone's phenotypic age or biological age.\"\n\nEssentially, everyone has two ages: a chronological age, how old the calendar says you are, and a phenotypic or biological age, basically the age at which your body functions as it compares to average fitness or health levels.\n\nRead More\n\n\"People of the same chronological age aren't all at the same risk for developing cardiovascular disease or cancer or even dying,\" Levine said. \"What [the biological age] does is actually give us a better idea of where someone stands for their age.\" \"Chronological age isn't how old we really are. It's a superficial number,\" said professor David Sinclair, co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School. \"We all age biologically at different rates according to our genes, what we eat, how much we exercise and what environmental toxins we are exposed to. Biological age is what determines our health and ultimately our lifespan. Biological age is number of candles we really should be blowing out. In the future, with advances in our ability to control biological age, we may have even fewer candles on our cake than the previous one.\" Slow down and live long with the ancient practice of qigong Levine and her team identified nine biomarkers taken in a simple blood test that seemed to be the most influential on lifespan. The biomarkers include blood sugar, kidney and liver measures, and immune and inflammatory measures. Levine plugs those numbers into the computer, and the algorithm does the rest. People with a biological age lower than their chronological age have a lower mortality risk, while those aging older from a biological standpoint have a higher mortality risk and are potentially more prone to developing the diseases associated with the higher age range. But perhaps what's most important here -- unlike results from genetic testing -- is that these are measures that can be changed. Doctors can take this information and empower patients to make changes to lifestyle, diet, exercise and sleep habits, and hopefully take steps to lower the risk and improve their biological age. Plants and extreme fitness: How one man added years to his life \"I think the most exciting thing about this research is that these things aren't set in stone,\" Levine said. \"We actually know a lot about how to change some of these markers. I think we are given the information much earlier in the process, hopefully before someone ever develops disease, and then they can really take steps to improve their health before its too late.\" Levine, who has been fascinated with aging ever since she was a young girl, even entered her own numbers into the algorithm. She was surprised by the results. \"I always considered myself a very healthy person,\" she said. \"I'm physically active; I eat what I consider to a fairly healthy diet.

Mortality in men was reduced in this period, but it remained approximately the same for women.\n\nRespiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known as COPD, are categorized as amenable diseases, says Dr. Justin Salciccioli, a resident and clinical fellow at Harvard Medical School and lead researcher on the analysis. \"The relevance of that is that with effective, timely and appropriate health care delivery, these deaths should be avoidable,\" he added.\n\nan analysis of the 2010 Global Burden of Disease The UK has been identified as an outlier on this issue, with work likean analysis of the 2010Global Burden of Disease study pointing out that it has higher mortality rates for COPD, a disease that was responsible for 3.17 million deaths globally in 2015.

The difference seems to affect a broader category of diseases that affect the lung in general, according to Salciccioli. \"The cause for concern would be that this is a difference that persists over time more than an absolute difference,\" he said. Salciccioli explained that with respect to deaths in men with lung cancer, the UK is \"just as good, if not better,\" as the majority of comparator countries. The study shows an observational trend and is not able to determine why there is a difference in death rates, but it is possible that lifestyle factors like smoking play a role, Salciccioli said. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Salciccioli hopes that the study will lead to a better understanding of what lies behind the differences between British mortality rates and those of other countries. Previous researched has suggested that high tobacco consumption in the UK could be linked to differences in mortality from respiratory diseases. But smoking has been on the decline in the UK, the study says. Pollution could be another possible explanation, the report's authors added. A 2017 WHO study reported 25.7 deaths per 100,000 people in the UK attributable to household and ambient air pollution, a greater rate than in most comparator countries, according to the WHO data. All countries studied showed a decrease in male mortality from respiratory conditions, but no sign of a decrease in female rates. Salciccioli believes that this is driven \"by the legacy of smoking\": Men had historically higher rates of smoking, and there have been significant improvements in reducing these. Salciccioli is not sure that smoking rates were cut among women as much as they have in men. Respiratory diseases are a large burden on health services, the study says.

Globally, Asia was the region with the highest number of women killed by partners or family members last year, at 20,000, followed by Africa (19,000), the Americas (8,000), Europe (3,000) and Oceania (300). However, rates were higher in Africa and the Americas, meaning women faced the greatest risk of being killed by partners or family members in these regions. In Africa, these homicides accounted for 3.1 victims per 100,000 of the female population and in the Americas, the rate was 1.6 victims per 100,000 of the female population -- compared with 0.9 per 100,000 in Asia. 'Dangerous' rape laws must be updated, Amnesty report says Europe showed the lowest rate of gender-based homicide, with 0.7 victims per 100,000 of the female population. While countries have taken various steps to address violence against women and gender-related killings -- including the adoption of special units and more training in the criminal justice system -- the report said there is no sign of a fall in the number of gender-related killings of women and girls worldwide. The total number of female homicide victims appears to have increased since 2012, it said, when the number of women killed by partners or family members was estimated at 48,000 -- or 47% of all female homicide victims. The new study has called for a series of measures to combat the global problem, including coordination between police, the criminal justice system, health and social services, and involving men more in addressing the problem. \"In order to prevent and tackle gender-related killing of women and girls, men need to be involved in efforts to combat intimate partner violence/family-related homicide and in changing cultural norms that move away from violent masculinity and gender stereotypes,\" it said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/health/home-most-dangerous-place-for-women-un-report/index.html", "published": "2018-11-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "FDA approves two cancer treatments after expedited reviews", "text": "(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration approved two cancer treatments, Vitrakvi and Xospata, this week after expedited reviews.\n\nVitrakvi , approved Monday, is \"a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker).\"\n\nThe FDA said in a statement that it is the second approved cancer treatment that is based on a tumor biomarker instead of the place in the body where the tumor originated.\n\nVitrakvi will be used for the treatment of solid tumors that have an NTRK (neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase) gene fusion that do not have a known resistance mutation, that are not metastatic or where surgical removal is likely to lead to severe morbidity, and that have no alternative treatments or have progressed after treatments.\n\nNTRK genes are rare but occur in many types of cancer, the FDA said, such as mammary analogue secretory carcinoma and infantile fibrosarcoma.\n\nRead More\n\nXospata tablets, approved Wednesday, are for the \"treatment of adult patients who have relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation,\" according to the FDA.

Up to 80 million people have chronic bad breath, according to the Academy of General Dentistry.\n\nBesides the obvious impact on your popularity, bad breath can be a sign of diseases and conditions, some serious.\n\nWhile you race for a mint, it might help to know the top 10 reasons why your breath smells bad in the first place and what you can do about it.\n\n1. You stink at brushing.\n\nYes, poor dental care is a leading cause of bad breath. When food is trapped between your teeth and under your gums, bacteria get busy breaking it down, leaving behind putrid gases that smell like rotten eggs or worse (even as bad as poop).\n\nOne way to tell if you have bad breath, dentists say, is to floss and then smell the thread. If there's a rank smell on the floss, you'll know for sure your breath is toxic.\n\nbrushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day and flossing regularly. While the brush is in there, don't forget your tongue and cheeks; The good news is that you can easily fix this type of bad breath bybrushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day and flossing regularly. While the brush is in there, don't forget your tongue and cheeks; studies show that brushing them can reduce bacteria load.\n\nCosmetic mouthwashes and gum only temporarily cover up the stink, dentists warn, because neither reduces bacteria.\n\n2. You ate or drank something smelly.\n\nCoffee. Garlic. Fish. Eggs. Onions. Spicy food. The foods we eat can easily cause bad breath.\n\nMany of the foods that contribute to stinky breath do so by releasing sulfides. Sulfur, as you know, smells like rotten eggs.\n\nA mint or stick of gum might mask the reek, but be warned: Odors from some of what you eat can stick around until the food works its way through your system -- even if you brush. According to the Academy of General Dentistry, the allyl methyl sulfide in coffee, onions and garlic can stay in your bloodstream and be expelled via your breath up to 72 hours after consumption.\n\nTry fighting back with other foods, such as lemons, parsley and crisp fruits and veggies such as apples or carrots that stimulate saliva production, which your mouth relies on to wash away impurities. Drinking water helps too! Caffeine, on the other hand, slows the production of saliva.\n\n3. You eat a lot of sweets.\n\nBefore you plop that next sugary candy, cake or cookie in your pie hole, listen closely. You might hear the chorus of cheers coming from the bacteria that live in your mouth. For them, sugar is a superfood, and boy, do they have a party gobbling it down, leaving a stink behind.\n\nDentists say sticky candies such as gummies and caramels are the worst offenders; if you must eat something sweet, they suggest (oh, joy!) plain chocolate. It has less sugar than many other candies and dissolves more quickly in the mouth.\n\n4. You're on a low-carb diet.\n\nEating a lot of protein and few carbs forces your body into ketosis, when your system begins to burn fat cells for energy.\n\nThe process creates waste products called ketones. Too many of those aren't good, so your body has no choice but to make you a walking stank house, excreting ketones via your urine and your breath. It's a rank odor, which many compare to rotten fruit.\n\nTry drinking extra water to flush ketones out of your body. If you use breath mints, candies or gum, be sure they are sugar-free.\n\n5. You're a mouth breather.\n\nAt night, saliva production is decreased , which is why many of us wake up with a rotten taste (and smell) in our mouths, even after diligent brushing and flossing.\n\nMouth breathing or snoring, such as from sleep apnea, further dries out the mouth, making your breath even more foul. Called xerostomia, dry mouth is not only unpleasant but potentially harmful. You might develop a sore throat, hoarseness, difficulty speaking and swallowing, problems wearing dentures and even a change in your sense of taste.\n\nThe solution: Get to the bottom of your mouth breathing problems and fix them while drinking lots of water and keeping up your dental hygiene both morning and night.\n\nOf course, dentists also suggest regular checkups. Don't be shy or embarrassed. If you tell your dentist about your persistent problem, he or she may be able to help pinpoint the cause.\n\n6. Your medications are partly to blame.\n\nHundreds of commonly used medications can dry out your mouth, contributing to rank breath. Some of the most common culprits are meds that treat anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, pain and muscle tension.\n\nCheck the drug's list of side effects to see whether dry mouth is on it, and then talk to your doctor about switching to a medication that doesn't reduce saliva.\n\n7. You've got a stuffy nose or allergies.\n\nDo you have chronic sinus infections? Respiratory illnesses? As your nose gets stuffy, you're more likely to be breathing through your mouth, drying out tissues and reducing saliva flow.\n\nIf you have allergies, the struggle to stop the constant drip-drip-drip with an antihistamine can lead to bad breath, as well. Many of the prescription and over-the-counter meds used to combat colds, flu and allergies dry up more than just the nose.\n\nAnd all that postnasal drip can cause a stink by ending up stuck on the back of your tongue, which is incredibly hard to reach with a toothbrush. Dentists recommend scraping the back of your tongue with a specially designed scraper and rinsing with a mouthwash containing chlorine dioxide.\n\n8. You smoke or chew tobacco (or other things).\n\nIf you're a smoker, you probably have no idea how the odor of tobacco clings to your clothes and belongings and especially your breath. Breathing in hot fumes dulls your senses, diminishing your ability to smell and taste\n\nObviously, hot air will also dry the mouth. The loss of saliva, combined with the odor of tobacco, creates the infamous \"smoker's breath.\" Cottonmouth is also a typical side effect of smoking or ingesting weed, a growing scenario across the country as more states legalize cannabis.\n\nChawing tobacky? It's a no-brainer that your teeth will stain, your gums will suffer, and your breath will stink.\n\nThe solution? You know.\n\n9. You drink alcohol.\n\nYup, we're still talking about things that dry out the mouth. That, my wine-loving, beer-drinking, cocktail-imbibing friends, includes alcohol. Not to mention wine contains sugar, as do many of the mixers used to create cocktails. Cue the cheering crowds of bacteria.\n\nFight back by sucking on sugar-free candies or chewing sugar-free gum, as both stimulate saliva production. Don't forget to drink water (it's also good in preventing hangovers) and brush and floss as soon as you can.\n\nBut here's an irony: A lot of mouthwashes and rinses contain alcohol. So if Hal. E. Tosis won't leave you alone, talk to your dentist about using a therapeutic mouthwash designed to reduce plaque instead.\n\n10. You have an underlying medical condition.\n\nDo you have heartburn, acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease? Puking up a bit of food or acid into your mouth can easily create bad breath. Don't write that off as just gross; untreated GERD can easily develop into a serious illness, even cancer.\n\nBad breath can also be an early sign of an underlying disease that may not have outward symptoms.\n\nOne of the signs of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition that affects mostly people with Type 1 diabetes, is fruity-smelling breath. It occurs because people with no to little insulin cannot metabolize ketone acids, allowing them to build up to toxic levels in the blood.\n\nSweet-smelling breath in a person with Type 1 diabetes should trigger prompt medical action. In rare cases, people with Type 2 diabetes can also develop the condition.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nPeople with severe, chronic kidney failure can have breath with an ammonia-like odor, which the US National Library of Medicine says can also be described as \"urine-like or 'fishy.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/health/halitosis-bad-breath-causes-remedies/index.html", "published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "6 subtle ways you're tricked into holiday shopping", "text": "(CNN) For most Americans, holiday shopping kicks off this week with Black Friday .\n\nIt's a time when retailers try to lure shoppers to their stores or websites, not only with discounted deals or special sales but with hidden cues that often go unnoticed.\n\nMany retailers have turned to psychology to manipulate shopping spaces, both in stores and online, to persuade customers to make purchases -- and more often than not, we can be oblivious to these mind games.\n\n\"It's amazing how these things are oftentimes not variables that we're aware of. A lot of these are peripheral cues,\" said Eric Spangenberg, professor and dean at The Paul Merage School of Business at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nFor instance, in a store, cues can be \"the scents, the sights, the sounds, the colors. It can also be things like the degree of crowding, the lighting and those kinds of things,\" he said.\n\nA store's ambiance can play a huge role in persuading people to buy more and get into the \"holiday shopping spirit,\" said Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, a personal finance expert and author of the book \"Zero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom.\"\n\n\"So if you walk right now into any retailer, you're going to hear festive music; you're going to have the smell of cinnamon and pine cones; you're going to see things that are very colorful and decorative,\" said Khalfani-Cox, who is also CEO and co-founder of the website Ask The Money Coach\n\n\"The experiences online differ -- in that, of course, you're not going to have the smells, per se -- but you'll definitely have brighter colors; larger holiday images that are more pronounced and kind of in your face on screen; the prices will be very small, but the happy, festive holiday image will be nice and big. Pop-up ads will appear more frequently.\"\n\nMore than 164 million people in the United States are planning to shop from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, according to a survey released last week by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics\n\nOf those who said they will be shopping, 65% are doing so to take advantage of deals and promotions, while 26% said that shopping over Thanksgiving weekend is a tradition, 23% said it is simply something to do, and the same percentage said it is when they start their holiday shopping, according to the survey.\n\nAs holiday shopping commences, here are just a few of the mind games that companies may use to entice you into buying more stuff.\n\n1. The alluring scent of a store\n\nYour nose could even play a role in convincing you to buy something.\n\n\"We know there are scents in particular and types of music that are seasonally affective or preferred, and we know that if we have the wrong cues at the wrong time of year, they can actually be detrimental to the kinds of behaviors that retailers want,\" Spangenberg said.\n\n\"If the scents are too complex or incongruent, that will not keep shoppers around or will not induce the kinds of behaviors that we want to induce,\" he said.\n\nFor instance, some consumers tend to purchase more premium products and brands when they are in a warm-scented environment, with smells such as vanilla or cinnamon, compared with a cool-scented environment, with smells such as peppermint or eucalyptus, according to a study published in the Journal of Marketing in 2015.\n\nThe study included a series of experiments, one of which involved 154 costumers in an optics retail store. The researchers measured the retailer's sales data when some customers shopped in the presence of a warm scent, compared with when the other customers shopped in the presence of a cool scent.\n\nThe researchers found that the customers in the warm-scent environment made significantly more purchases of premium-brand eyewear than those in the cool-scent environment.\n\nPremium brands accounted for 11.4% of all purchases in the warm-scent environment, compared with 3.2% in the cool-scent environment, according to the study.\n\n2. Shopping to the beat\n\nMusic and background noise also may influence your shopping habits , research suggests.\n\n\"There were some studies back in the '80s that demonstrated that shopping behaviors were directly influenced by the tempo,\" Spangenberg said. \"So, too fast moved people through the environment too quickly.\"\n\nOn the other hand, a study presented last year at the International Conference on Economics and Management Engineering found that consumers are more likely to impulsively buy products in the presence of faster background music compared with background music that has a slower rhythm.\n\nThe study included 409 shoppers in Chaoyang Joy City shopping center, a mall in Beijing, where background music was playing. The rhythm of the music was classified as fast if it had 94 beats per minute or above and as slow if it had 72 beats per minute or less.\n\nThe shoppers were asked to complete questionnaires about how much they had planned to spend and what they actually purchased.\n\nThe researchers wrote that consumers were \"more likely to have impulsive buying when the background music rhythm is faster.\"\n\n3. The power of 'grouping'\n\nWhen items are displayed as being part of a set or complete outfit, we also might be willing to spend more or impulsively buy the whole set instead of just one item.\n\nThe tactic of presenting products as a set is called grouping, Khalfani-Cox said.\n\nRetailers may \"strategically place them adjacent to one another in order to create the not-so-subtle suggestion that for this gift to work or for this gift to be complete, you need to buy all three or four of these items,\" she said.\n\nSpangenberg and his colleagues recently studied this practice, and their research is in the review process to be published, he said.\n\n\"We found that if you couch things as pieces of a puzzle or part of a set, that people will feel what we call the 'incompleteness effect,' and it's actually that people will want to complete the whole set,\" Spangenberg said.\n\n\"It's kind of like you left something out if you don't have this entire set,\" he said.\n\n4. When salespeople get snooty\n\nThe salespeople you encounter in a store can be just as influential as the store ambiance itself.\n\nThe study involved four experiments that examined how consumers respond to being rejected by a salesperson at a luxury store, such as Gucci or Burberry, versus a mass-market store, such as American Eagle or H&M.\n\nJUST WATCHED Shopping with a flair: How luxury shopping is becoming an experience Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Shopping with a flair: How luxury shopping is becoming an experience 03:26\n\nIn one of the experiments, 358 women were asked to read shopping scenarios in a store, with some imagining a salesperson acting condescending toward them. Then, the women answered a series of questions about that store's products and their willingness to pay for an average product from the store brand.\n\nThe researchers found that when the study participants imagined being rejected by the salesperson at a luxury store, versus being greeted neutrally, they were willing to pay more for the brand. Yet when they imagined being rejected at a mass-market store, versus being greeted neutrally, there was no difference in their willingness to pay.\n\nIn other words, \"one subtle button that some salespeople will try to push is to tap into your feeling of inadequacy,\" said Khalfani-Cox, who was not involved in that study.\n\n\"It sounds a little crazy. It sounds almost offensive, but it's incredibly effective,\" she said.\n\n5. The deceptive display\n\nThe way products are displayed in a store just might influence your willingness to make a purchase, too.\n\nRetailers may display differently priced versions of a product next to each other -- a move called framing -- to entice shoppers to spend more, Khalfani-Cox said.\n\n\"Framing is where retailers will put two similar items that have different price points and display them in a way that subtly tries to upsell you,\" she said. \"So the framing exercise is really to mentally give you a frame of reference for a baseline of cost and then to subtly move you toward getting that higher-priced item.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Future of retail brings technology to stores Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Future of retail brings technology to stores 02:20\n\nSimply seeing the real-life display can also influence a buying decision, research suggests.\n\nA 2010 paper published in the American Economic Review found that a shopper's willingness to pay for a product is 40% to 61% higher when the item is actually displayed before them than when they view only an image and text display.\n\nThe paper described a series of four experiments, during which researchers evaluated whether the way in which items were displayed affected the dollar value that participants placed on them. The participants were undergraduate and graduate students at the California Institute of Technology.\n\n6.

She added that the agency issued its Medical Device Safety Action Plan in April, laying out what it has done and what new steps it plans to take to enhance device safety.\n\n\"These actions are things that we've been working on for quite a while,\" Kotz said.\n\nStill, the concurrent release of information from the government regulator and the investigative team highlights the many challenges and missteps related to patient safety.\n\nThousands of devices\n\n\"The FDA regulates more than 190,000 different devices, which are manufactured by more than 18,000 firms in more than 21,000 medical device facilities worldwide,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Jeff Shuren, director of the agency's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement last week announcing the agency's plans. \"On average, we approve, clear or grant marketing authorization to approximately 12 new or modified devices every business day after carefully determining -- based on valid scientific evidence -- that the devices are safe and effective.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the journalism collaboration, which included more than 250 journalists based in 36 countries, examined more than 8 million device-related health records, including death and injury reports. Called the \" Implant Files ,\" the extensive analysis of pacemakers, insulin pumps, breast implants, spinal cord stimulators and other surgically embedded appliances and materials found nearly 83,000 deaths and more than 1.7 million injuries possibly linked to medical devices and reported in the United States alone since 2008.\n\nOver the past decade, manufacturers have also paid out at least $1.6 billion to settle charges of regulatory violations, including corruption and fraud, around the world, according to the consortium, which published its analysis Sunday.\n\n\"Patients around the world have become unwitting test subjects for new medical technology,\" the consortium said. \"Often following the trusted advice of their doctors, they have been injured, maimed and killed by poorly-tested implants.\"\n\nNathan Cortez , a professor and associate dean for research at Southern Methodist University Law School, explained that \"the process for FDA to review medical devices was established by Congress in 1976.\" He noted that in the 42 years since, \"a lot of new medical devices\" have been introduced into the US market.\n\n\"What the general public probably doesn't understand is that many medical devices allowed on the market haven't received much in-depth scrutiny from the FDA,\" Cortez, who was not involved in the consortium's work or the FDA's plans, wrote in an email. \"Some have; but most haven't.\n\n\"For well over a decade, the FDA has had to listen to critiques from the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine), as well as academics, members of Congress, and manufacturers,\" he wrote.\n\nWhat is the FDA, tasked only with protecting American patients, doing to improve its own performance?\n\nA big element of its plan is \"trying to implement a more active surveillance system to learn more about medical device problems,\" Kotz said. This system is known as NEST, the National Evaluation System for health Technology\n\nFDA wants an active not passive surveillance capability\n\nFrequently, the FDA learns about device risk through the existing passive reporting system, by which doctors, hospitals, manufacturers and patients can post problems to an agency database, according to Kotz. \"We analyze those, and if we see a signal, we can take action: We can ask the company to do a recall; we can issue a change of labeling, a safety communication.\"\n\nBut there are limits to this \"passive reporting\" system, she said. \"A lot of the time, there's under-reporting, and we don't necessarily get a real-time look at what's happening. So we're trying to switch to this active system that we call NEST.\"\n\nNEST relies on real-world evidence, including anonymized information from insurance claims, patient registries, and electronic health records, Kotz said. Combing through this data, the FDA would be able to see, in real time, which devices might be causing problems.\n\nAnother important component of NEST is the Unique Device Identification system, in which devices are marked with a specific code and if a particular device, model or batch of medical devices malfunction or become contaminated, the FDA can pull it from the market.\n\nNEST, if funded by Congress, will help the FDA in its efforts to monitor the general medical device industry, yet device therapies unique to women's health require additional surveillance systems, Gottlieb and Shuren said. They noted that \"the President's budget for fiscal year 2019 includes a request for an additional $46 million\" to support NEST.\n\nWomen's health in the spotlight\n\nTherapies unique to women, including treatments for uterine fibroids, pelvic floor disorder, female sterilization and long-acting reversible contraception, will become the focus of the FDA, Gottlieb and Shuren said. To evaluate real-world data on the safety and performance of medical products, the FDA will strengthen its Coordinated Registry Networks and, separately, its National Breast Implant Registry.\n\n\"We've heard from patients who are concerned that their implants may be linked to other health conditions, like chronic fatigue, cognitive issues and muscle pain,\" Gottlieb and Shuren said.\n\nAnother FDA concern is the \"growing number\" of manufacturers marketing \"vaginal rejuvenation\" devices to treat conditions and symptoms related to menopause, urinary incontinence or sexual function.\n\nFinally, the FDA will convene an advisory committee in February to discuss the safety and effectiveness of surgical mesh for transvaginal pelvic organ prolapse repair.

Many implanted devices are installed adjacent to vital organs or pressed against sensitive nerves, meaning removal may carry risks of serious injury or death,\" the consortium notes. \"Nearly 500,000 reports over the last decade describe explant surgeries in connection with a medical device.\"\n\nCortez said the FDA's modernization program \"looks like the agency is trying to turn 510(k) reviews into a more rigorous process.

The horse rolled onto Anderson, who hit her head, briefly lost consciousness and broke three ribs.\n\nThe 911 transcript shows that an ambulance reached the 60-year-old judge from Bismarck within 20 minutes. Anderson was secured on a backboard and ready to go when an air ambulance, a helicopter with a medical crew, also landed at the scene. Anderson says her husband asked repeatedly whether the ground ambulance crew could take her by ground; there was a hospital less than an hour's drive away.\n\n\"But he was told that [the air ambulance] was necessary. They never told him why it was necessary or how much it cost, but they insisted I had to go by air ambulance,\" Anderson said. \"But it's so odd there is nothing in the record that indicated it was time-sensitive or that I needed to be airlifted.\"\n\nFor that one helicopter ride, to a hospital farther away in Bismarck, records show that Valley Med Flight charged Anderson $54,727.26. Sanford Health Plan, her insurance, paid $13,697.73. That left Anderson with a $41,029.53 bill.\n\nValley Med Flight did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"It shocked me,\" Anderson said. \"I kept thinking, 'my God.' I got a copy of the 911 and air ambulance report to see how long they actually spent with me, when really, it was only around 45 minutes. I wrote [the air ambulance company] a letter telling them that I thought it was all outrageous.\"\n\nShared outrage\n\nabout air ambulance bills have Anderson is not alone. CNN reached out to every state's insurance regulatory office. Nearly every one said it has heard from patients like Anderson, and complaintsabout air ambulance bills have \"increased rapidly,\" according to the Mississippi commissioner of insurance.\n\nCharges vary wildly. CNN saw bills ranging from nearly $34,000 to more than $533,000.\n\nflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state 2017 federal investigation found that costs for an average air ambulanceflight doubled between 2010 and 2014. Some states saw even bigger increases. New Mexico bills went up 229% between 2006 and 2015, a state investigation found.\n\nEach state's law varies in what can be disclosed about these complaints due to its interpretation of patient privacy. In some cases, CNN could see details about the patient's condition, how far and where they were flown, how much they were charged, how much insurance paid and the nature of the complaint. Some states released much less. Some would acknowledge only that there had been complaints. However, it's clear that these bills can be devastating for families.\n\nOne complaint sent to the Michigan insurance office says a family flew a dying relative home after he got sick in Arizona. To get him to a hospice in Michigan cost $547,725.\n\nIt cost another family $62,749.35 to fly a child with a malignant brain tumor from Wisconsin to Houston to see a specialist.\n\nBut these high prices aren't just for cross-country flights. An air ambulance transferred a man from a hospital in Winter Haven, Florida, to one in Orlando for tests, which would be a one-hour drive. The complaint to the Michigan insurance office about that Florida flight said the family faced a $31,253.33 bill.\n\nJUST WATCHED $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH $4,680 bill for air ambulance hits 17 years later 02:02\n\nEmergency personnel requested another hospital-to-hospital transfer in Arkansas for an X-ray. It cost $37,850, according to a letter to the state insurance department.\n\n\"We carry insurance to avoid the catastrophic situations,\" wrote the man, whose name was redacted. \"I don't see where the consumer is getting a fair shake in this deal.\"\n\nThe desire may be there for change, but nothing's worked.\n\nThe price of these flights is not regulated by Obamacare. Instead, they fall under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act , which removed a state's ability to control airfares and routes long before air ambulances were common. October's Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act created a committee to address the problem, but it failed to design a definitive solution, experts say.\n\nAir ambulances take off\n\nAir ambulances became necessary out of a desperate need to save lives, but some question whether their value remains.\n\nIn 1966, civilian deaths from accidental injuries were \"a public health problem second only to the ravages of ancient plagues or world wars,\" the National Academy of Sciences wrote at the time.\n\nAir ambulances weren't a regular civilian option then, but when researchers discovered that soldiers wounded in the Vietnam War had better survival rates than California motorists injured in car accidents, the US government decided to fund two medical helicopter experiments in 1969. They were successful, and hospitals slowly started creating their own programs.\n\nThe golden hour\n\nA 'cash cow'\n\nthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion Demand for services wasn't the industry's only growth driver. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new fee schedule that was much more generous to independent operators and paid more for rural trips. Almost immediately, new companies entered the market. Private equity firms, not hospitals, now ownthe three largest air ambulance providers in the United States. Bain Capital bought Air Medical for $1 billion in 2010 and sold it five years later for $2 billion\n\nAs private companies got into the market, prices went up. Between 2010 and 2014, the median price that air ambulance companies charged Medicare doubled to nearly $30,000 a ride, according to a 2017 US Government Accountability Office investigation\n\n\"They have a cash cow on their hands,\" New Mexico state Rep. Liz Thomson said.\n\nThomson said a state analysis also found a 98% increase in the amount charged by air ambulance providers that weren't covered by insurance between 2009 and 2015. When patients travel on helicopters that are not in-network, insurance will cover little or nothing at all.\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services says more firms are accepting insurance -- about a dozen announced that they were going in-network this year -- but still too many do not, Thomson said, and that can be a serious issue.\n\n\"If they aren't in a network, they don't have to adhere to the usual customary fees that insurance will pay,\" said Susan Rider, an employee benefits and human capital HR consultant with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis. \"They don't have to participate, so they don't, and then essentially, they can charge what they want.\"\n\nIn 2017, Thomson introduced a bill to cap reimbursement rates and let consumers off the hook for \"balance bills,\" meaning what consumers owe above what insurance pays. The bill failed in the New Mexico Legislature, but she hopes to introduce it again.\n\nThe air ambulance industry packed the committee hearing room when Thomson introduced the bill, but it was not alone.\n\n\"I'm a Democrat and introduce a lot of legislation around patient protection, so I had a running joke that while I don't drink, I would drink a bottle of champagne if the [insurance?] industry ever stood up for any of my bills,\" Thomson said. \"Sure enough, I needed to buy a bottle, because when the chair asked who was in favor of the bill, all these insurance people stood up and said, 'we are.' This practice is costing them a mint. It's outrageous.\"\n\nMike Castleberry , senior vice president of network services and business development for HealthSCOPE Benefits , a national firm that helps major companies manage health plans, said the costs for these services don't add up. \"When you really get into the math, it starts to get embarrassing for the folks running those businesses,\" he said.\n\n\"We know what their fuel costs. We know how many hours they fly and how much it costs for a pilot,\" Castleberry said. \"Add up all those factors, even if you give them a 20% profit on top of that, that's still not even half what they are charging me, which is more like 300 to 400 times what it actually costs to fly our customers. When I can go rent a private plane and put medical personnel on board for less than some of these bills, I know it shouldn't cost this much.\"\n\nHe also notes that a lot of patients whose bills the firm sees, who are told to take these flights, aren't trauma cases. \"They are not for a wreck on the side of the road needing Level I trauma care,\" Castleberry said. \"Only about 15% of the air ambulance charges we see involve those kind of accidents. The vast majority are patient transfers from one facility to the other.\"\n\nCastleberry, who has clients across the country, said private operators aren't the only ones making money. \"County governments and city hospitals [which can have their own air ambulance services] also see it as a revenue stream that supports their overall programs,\" he said.\n\nThe actual costs\n\nThe air medical transport industry argues that although single flights \"may appear to be expensive,\" they are \"very cost-effective\" compared with building new rural specialty care or expanding ground ambulance capabilities.\n\nStaffing an independent helicopter around the clock is expensive. It costs about $3 million to run an independent air medical base that does roughly 300 transports a year, said Chris Eastlee , vice president of government relations for the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nSome in the industry argue the problem is that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't pay enough. They created current rates in 2002, based on an estimated 1998 cost pool, increasing reimbursement for inflation only. \"It was never based on real cost collection,\" said Rick Sherlock , the association's ex-officio president and CEO.\n\nAbout 70% to 80% of the patients whom air ambulances transport fall into these categories that the industry argue significantly underpay, like patients with Medicare. This payment is significantly less than the cost of the transportation, Sherlock said.\n\n\"Medicare pays about 60% of the cost of the flight; Medicaid pays 35% or less. Self-paid patients pay a few cents on the dollar, and that has led to a crisis of being able to sustain the service,\" Eastlee said. That means about 7 out of 10 of the association's flights are under-reimbursed, he said.\n\nIf the government reimburses the industry more, Sherlock said, \"you eliminate the need to balance bill.\"\n\nThe insured pay the costs\n\nAnderson, who was billed $54,727.26 total for her air ambulance rescue from the Badlands, got a letter from the air ambulance company's lawyer when she wrote to protest the price. HIs letter explains that 75% of that company's patients are covered by the government or have no insurance at all.\n\n\"This governmentally mandated cost shifting means that their cost per transport must be borne by others,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"In other words, I may not have had $54,000 worth of treatment, but essentially, they have to make up their costs somehow,\" Anderson said. \"It's not fair at all.\"\n\n\"Some of these bills are pretty egregious, and these are consumers who have done everything right,\" Godfread said. \"They have health insurance, they ask questions ahead of time, and often, they don't get to make the choice. It's often the hospital or the EMTs that decide to fly, but consumers are the ones left paying the bills, and there's really no way for consumers to protect themselves.\"\n\nAndrei Courier learned that the hard way in June. He got a $41,063.78 bill after the in-network hospital where he took his son Jacob with breathing problems transferred the boy to an out-of-network hospital.\n\nJacob Courier's air ambulance hospital transfer cost $41,063.78.\n\n\"First, I could have driven to that other hospital faster,\" Courier said. \"We also had tried to do everything in-network. We did everything right insurance-wise, but we still faced this huge bill.\"\n\nHis insurance company picked up $8,960.49 of the bill, that meant he would be left paying $32,103.29 out-of-pocket.\n\n\"We work hard, we pay our bills on time, and this is how we are repaid,\" Courier said. \"It was so frustrating. That's money we would use for my son's college, not for a short helicopter ride.\"\n\nCourier made multiple phone calls to the company, a lawyer and the Mississippi insurance commissioner. He learned that the state has a law that prevents balance billing , which is when insurance covers part of the bill and the patient owes the rest. Eventually, the cost of the flight was forgiven.\n\n\"I don't know what the insurance commissioner said to the company, but I finally got a call and was told they weren't going to balance bill me,\" Courier said, but he's still upset.\n\nMed Trans Air Medical Transport, which ran the air ambulance that day, referred questions to the Association of Air Medical Services.\n\nStates try to help\n\nOther state insurance offices say usually there's little they can do, beyond holding insurance companies to the letter of their policies. Most offices encourage patients to call with complaints.\n\nThough states like Mississippi have balance billing protection, that tactic has had limited success elsewhere, as the courts have ruled that laws affecting air ambulances are federal, not state, jurisdiction.\n\nNorth Dakota tried another approach. Its 2015 law required providers to disclose prices before the flight, upon request. Hospitals that referred a patient to the air ambulance company had to let the patient know the cost ahead of time unless the hospital determined that doing so would jeopardize their health or safety, in which case they would be exempt. The courts overturned that legislation, ruling that it was a federal matter.\n\nNorth Dakota's 2017 legislation requires hospitals to notify patients in non-emergency situations if the helicopter takes their insurance. \"We are optimistic. It is squarely in the claims process that we have the authority to regulate,\" Godfread said. \"It will, however, likely be appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Association of Air Medical Services believes that the states can \"help patients right now and help address the issue of balance billing and take patients out of the middle,\" Eastlee said. \"Some insurance only covers a fraction of the price for those transports. We can work together.\"\n\nThe Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\" Virginia is trying another approach. Starting in March, its new law will require hospitals tell patients who don't have an \"emergency medical condition\" that they have a choice between air and ground transportation.The Office of Emergency Medical Services must establish a mechanism by January to give the patient a \"good faith estimate.\"\n\nCongress and the law\n\nIt will probably take an act of Congress to regulate the air ambulance industry. The FAA Reauthorization Act , passed in October, created an advisory committee with all the players involved who will focus on improving price transparency. The law gives the Department of Transportation and the Department of Health and Human Services authority to create new rules. It establishes a hotline and website to track complaints, and it creates an aviation consumer advocate position.\n\n\"It was important to me that we craft a solution that not only empowers consumers and patients but lays the groundwork for long-term solutions in the industry,\" said US Rep. Rob Woodall of Georgia, who added the air ambulance-specific language to the bill. \"By creating an aviation consumer advocate, much like the taxpayer advocate for those with complaints against the IRS, my amendment provides a clear mechanism through which consumers can pursue enforcement or corrective actions -- which to this point had been absent in these situations.\"\n\nThe industry association said that it supports the FAA Reauthorization Act because it \"enhanced consumer protection\" and that the industry does want more transparency and accountability, Eastlee said, \"but we also have to work to sustain the service.\"\n\nSherlock added, \"the amendment does not address the underlying problem to reduce the patient's balance bill .\"\n\nFor Anderson, Congress is too late. She took her own action. Instead of paying $41,029.53 out of pocket, she offered to settle for $4,100, on top of the $13,000 her insurance paid.\n\n\"I thought, I didn't want them to sue me and wanted to get this out of the way and thought 10% more was reasonable,\" Anderson said. For three months, she heard nothing from the company, so she wrote to withdraw her offer. The next month, the company offered to negotiate, documents show, but eventually, it accepted her offer.\n\nAnderson's recovered from her injuries. And Cody, her horse, is OK. She brought him some extra feed to thank him, as the X-rays detected another medical issue she is now in treatment for. But the experience with the air ambulance still bothers her.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"For a little more than 45 minutes of service, they were asking for more than what my surgeon charged. It's not fair,\" Anderson said. \"I've since talked to other people who have been transported with no surprise bills, I think air ambulances can run in a fair manner, but the way it is currently done seems unfair and unreasonable. No one should feel shocked or panicked by a bill like this. No one ever.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/26/health/air-ambulance-high-price/index.html", "published": "2018-11-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why you stayed in that unhappy relationship for too long", "text": "(CNN) Thanks to \"Sex and the City,\" we're all familiar with the phrase \"he's just not that into you.\" Yet many couples who are no longer all that into each other choose to stay together anyway.\n\nWhy do people choose to remain in unhappy relationships? According to a recent pair of studies , the more people believe their partner is dependent on the relationship, the less likely they are to initiate a breakup. In other words, you might be motivated to stay in an unfulfilling relationship for the sake of your partner.\n\nI asked some of my colleagues to share more about why unhappy couples stick together -- and how you can end a relationship a little less painfully if you choose to break up.\n\nStaying together can be selfless -- or selfish\n\nThe recent studies suggest that people stay in unsatisfying relationships because they're concerned about hurting their partner's feelings.\n\n\"In my experience, there are most often underlying fears and insecurities that prevent people from moving forward into a life that might be less comfortable but ultimately happier and more authentic. These couples tend to settle into a 'good enough' relationship,\" sex therapist Holly Richmond said. \"But there is almost always a point where it's obvious that not good enough is truly not good enough, and it causes more harm to the unhappy person to stay than it would to their partner if they left.\"\n\nConcerns about children, finances, friends, lifestyle and standing in the community can also influence the decision to stay together. \"In my practice, I see clients who stay in relationships because they're worried they won't find another partner, while others remain because they don't want to deprive their children from having the other parent in their day-to-day life,\" sex therapist Sari Cooper said.\n\nBut staying in an unhappy relationship doesn't do anyone any favors, sex therapist Kristen Lilla said. \"Staying because you don't want to hurt someone else is selfish because it takes away the other person's agency to make a decision,\" she explained. \"You are deciding that your partner will not be OK without you, so you stay with them out of pity.\"\n\nShould you stay or should you go?\n\nClearly, the decision to end a relationship can be a difficult one for many people. It can be helpful to visualize your life after the breakup, Cooper said. \"I ask clients to imagine in great detail what their life would be like: Will they able to support themselves financially? Will they feel that they did all they could to improve the relationship? Will they face a loss of a community in addition to the relationship?\"\n\nSex therapist Kristie Overstreet agreed. \"If you're trying to decide whether to stay in the relationship or leave it, write out the pros and cons of the decision. This forces you to use logic versus emotions and helps you identify things that you wouldn't have realized before,\" she explained. \"One of the most important questions you can ask yourself is if you have done everything you could do from your end to make it work. Make sure you have checked off all of the boxes on your list, which will help you come to your decision.\"\n\nYou might also try picturing your relationship as a box that's large enough for both of you to move around comfortably within the space, with each of you supporting one another's growth.\n\n\"An unhealthy relationship means that the relationship box you are in is too small for each of you to be independent and separate, and you feel lost and frightened without the other person,\" sex therapist Tammy Nelson said. \"You may have been taught that this is what true love is -- a soul mate that is your other half -- but this is really codependency. If you don't have enough room to grow as a whole person in a relationship, you may not only be holding yourself back but your partner as well.\"\n\nBreaking up is hard to do\n\nThere's certainly some truth to this clich\u00e9: \"There's no way to break up with someone without the risk of hurting them,\" sex therapist Deborah Fox said. That said, Fox stresses it's important to be honest with your partner about why you want to end the relationship.\n\n\"Although it's not necessary to include every reason, you should end a relationship with integrity, which means with honesty,\" she explained. \"Little white lies can be justified in a short, barely-off-the-ground relationship but not in one of any length.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverstreet agreed. \"You can't prevent your partner from hurting over your decision. However, being truthful and respectful during the process will help lessen hurt,\" she said. \"The way you handle yourself and your words are the only things you have control over. Remember that you have to do whatever you need to so that you remain healthy -- and leaving an unhealthy relationship is one of the steps in that direction.\"\n\nThe choice to break up is rarely an easy one, but by putting the time and thought into the decision, you can make things a little easier -- both for you and for your partner.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/23/health/bad-relationship-unhappy-sex-kerner/index.html", "published": "2018-11-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "15 takeaways from the US climate change report", "text": "(CNN) The average global temperature is much higher and rising more rapidly than \"anything modern civilization has experienced,\" according to David Easterling , one of the authors of a new US government report that delivers a dire warning about our future.\n\nThousands more could die, food will be scarcer, and the US economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century.\n\nReleased Friday, the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government. It comes from the US Global Change Research Program , a team of 13 federal agencies, and is the second of two volumes. The first, released in November 2017, concluded that there is \"no convincing alternative explanation\" for the changing climate other than \"human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases.\"\n\nThe report breaks down the possible impact of climate change by US region and looks at the effects climate change will have on health , economy and infrastructure. Here are some of its key predictions:\n\n1. Crop production will decline.\n\nFarmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of crops will decline across the United States due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding.\n\nIn parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce only about 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybeans.\n\nBy 2100, higher temperatures in places like Yolo County, California, could make it too hot to cultivate walnuts. Climate change could also severely limit almond production in California.\n\n2. Cows could have it bad.\n\nHeat stress, which cost the dairy industry $1.2 billion in 2010, will become an even bigger issue, potentially causing average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years.\n\nLivestock for meat could struggle to find plants to graze on, and heat stress could impact their numbers.\n\n3. Food sources from the sea will decline.\n\nThere won't be as many oysters, shrimp or crab due to ocean acidification. The report predicts a $230 million loss for that industry by the end of the century. Annual oyster harvests in the Southeast will decline by 46% under the worst-case scenario by the end of the century.\n\nFish stocks overall may decline as red tides -- algae bloom that deplete oxygen in the water and can kill sea life -- become more common. It was a red tide that triggered a state of emergency in Florida in August.\n\nThe coral reefs that support diverse fish life off the Florida Keys are already declining and could be lost in the coming decades due to higher temperatures.\n\nRiver fish could also die off; higher temperatures have already led to die-offs due to proliferative kidney disease\n\nWarmer temperatures were a problem for endangered sockeye salmon and Chinook in the Columbia River when they suffered a serious die-off in 2015.\n\n4. Food- and waterborne illness will spread.\n\nWeather that is bad for farmers is good for spreading food- and waterborne diseases, and more people will be exposed to them.\n\nMarine toxins and pathogens will contaminate seafood. The waterborne bacteria Vibrio, which is already causing thousands of illnesses a year, will expand to seafood in northern seas and affect oysters grown in the Northeast\n\nFloods and heavy rains that can cause sewers to overflow can contaminate drinking water, leading to more stomach problems, studies have shown\n\nDroughts could cause more skin and eye infections, due to lack of water for personal hygiene. Other waterborne diseases that could spread include hepatitis A, salmonellosis, shigellosis, typhoid and E. coli.\n\n5. Bugs will bug us more.\n\nWeather that's bad for crops is good for bugs.\n\nMosquitoes and ticks love warmer and wetter temperatures. That means diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika will be more widespread. West Nile cases are expected to more than double by 2050 due to increasing temperatures.\n\nThe Northeast could see more cases of Lyme disease as the tick season expands in states like Maine and Pennsylvania.\n\n6. It will be hard to breathe.\n\nAsthma and allergies will also be worse due to climate change . The pollen season will intensify and lengthen in parts of the United States due to warmer temperatures.\n\nOak pollen in the Midwest will send more people to the emergency room for asthma, costing up to $170,000 annually , according to the report.\n\nUrban areas with higher concentrations of CO2 will see more allergy-causing plants such as ragweed growing faster.\n\nIncreased rain in some areas will encourage mold growth indoors, which can make asthma symptoms worse.\n\n7. Mental health will be challenged.\n\nExtreme weather can have serious mental health consequences and lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression.\n\nExposure to extreme heat, for instance, is associated with aggressive behavior, suicide, violence and higher admissions to hospitals for people who have a mental illness, studies have shown.\n\nExtreme temperatures can also increase stress levels. Worsening air quality limits the time people can exercise or socialize outside; both activities are big stress relievers, studies have shown.\n\n8. More of us will die.\n\nHigher temperatures will also kill more people, the report says. The Midwest alone, which is predicted to have the largest increase in extreme temperatures, will see an additional 2,000 premature deaths per year by 2090.\n\nPeople who live in Rhode Island could see an additional 1,500 heat-related ER visits by 2095, and some of those visits will end in death, according to the report.\n\nPoor air quality can also lead to more strokes and heart attacks.\n\nThe heat will be a problem for elderly people with chronic conditions, increasing the death rate by 2.8% to 4% with each increase of approximately 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in summer temperature\n\n9. We won't be able to work as much.\n\nThe Southeast alone will probably lose 570 million labor hours by 2090.\n\nIn the worst-case scenario for farm workers, by the end of the century, high temperatures will add up to a loss of 2 billion labor hours, equating to an estimated $160 billion in 2015 dollars.\n\nIn Chicago, it will be a lot harder to work outside when 100-degree days, rare now, become increasingly common. By late century, the report predicts that the city could see almost 60 days a year over 100, making it more like present-day Phoenix or Las Vegas.\n\n10. We won't be able to get around as easily.\n\nInfrastructure is vulnerable to increasing temperatures and wet seasons.\n\nBy 2050, the Southeast will have the most vulnerable bridges at risk of failure, and more dams will probably break with increased hurricanes and rain.\n\nThe East Coast now has 7,508 miles of roadways threatened by high tide coastal flooding, and that problem will only get worse with climate change\n\nTrain systems like Atlanta's MARTA could fail in extreme rains. MARTA authorities are trying to identify what parts of the system are most vulnerable to climate change and are trying to make improvements before problems start.\n\n11. Water infrastructure will be challenged.\n\nStorm water systems weren't built to withstand the extreme rain that comes with climate change. The cost of adapting urban storm water systems in the Midwest, for example, could exceed $480 million per year.\n\nThe total cost to remediate sanitation facility deficiencies to provide safe water and sewers for American Indians in the Northern Great Plains could be around $280 million.\n\nThese populations are already vulnerable to climate change. For example , Standing Rock ran out of water during a 2003 drought.\n\n12. Floods will be more frequent.\n\nCharleston is trying to shore things up because it is predicted to have 180 tidal floods per year by 2045, compared with 11 it had in 2014. Each flood event costs the city $12.4 million (in 2009 dollars), studies show.\n\nOther Southeast coastal cities like Wilmington, North Carolina, and Miami and Key West, Florida, have set records for coastal flooding in recent years.

They've been collecting samples in jars and using bottled or spring water, even though the local and state government assured them it was safe.\n\nBut through a Freedom of Information Act request and a one-year investigation, CNN has found new information that may cast doubts on those assurances.\n\nThe state government was adding a substance to one of the city's four wells, trying to regulate naturally occurring iron bacteria that can leave red stains or rust-like deposits in the water. The substance, known as HaloSan, was not approved by the US Environmental Protection Agency to disinfect drinking water.\n\nThe city's mayor says that all of the city's wells flow into one system to be distributed throughout the city.\n\nThe EPA and the state of South Carolina have confirmed to CNN that there is now an open investigation into how this happened, although neither would comment on the target of the probe or the scope.\n\nIt's unclear what the effects of HaloSan might have been on the almost 3,000 people who live in this rural, tight-knit community, but a group of about 40 residents believe the water is to blame for illnesses and maladies they say they're suffering from.\n\nThe chemical is typically used as a disinfectant for pools and spas, but several experts contacted by CNN said they could not find another instance where it was added to a drinking water system.\n\nOne thing is clear -- the state of South Carolina approved its use, and it should not have. It was used for 10 years.\n\nCNN was told by the state that it has been adding HaloSan to the water in Denmark since 2008.\n\nA spokesman for South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control told CNN in an email that it believed HaloSan was EPA-approved for drinking water based on the way the system was \"advertised.\"\n\n\"The Berry Systems HaloSan treatment unit had been advertised as an effective treatment in the control of iron bacteria and was certified ... \" said Tommy Crosby, director of media relations for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.\n\nBerry Systems, the makers of HaloSan, has not responded to multiple phone calls and emails by CNN requesting comment.\n\n\"It was our thinking that it was an approved chemical to be used,\" said Gerald Wright, mayor of Denmark, South Carolina. \"We rely totally on DHEC because they have the responsibility and expertise to test, monitor and advise.\"\n\nAn EPA spokesperson tells CNN that HaloSan is not approved to be used to treat drinking water.\n\n\"HaloSan has not undergone the necessary evaluations as part of the pesticide registration process and, therefore, EPA cannot confirm the safe use of this product for the disinfection of drinking water,\" according to the EPA.\n\nAn EPA risk assessment from 2007 shows that HaloSan can be a \"significant eye and skin irritant.\" Other effects can include \"burning, rash, itching, skin discoloration/redness, blistering, allergic type reactions including hives/welts, allergic contact dermatitis, and bleeding also have been reported. ... Eye pain and swelling of eyes also has been reported in some incidences.\"\n\nDisinfectants fall under the EPA pesticide program.\n\nThe EPA told CNN that HaloSan is not a registered pesticide product and has not been reviewed by EPA's pesticide program. By law, \"a product intended to be used to disinfect drinking water must be registered by the Environmental Protection Agency,\" and have scientific data that demonstrates that the product \"can perform its intended function without undue harm to people or the environment.\"\n\nAn April 2018 presentation by South Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control shows that one of Denmark's wells was treated with HaloSan.\n\nThe EPA also says that dosage must be regulated when being used for its intended purposes in pesticides. In Denmark's drinking water, it's unclear if it was regulated or filtered.\n\nWright tells CNN that he defers to South Carolina's DHEC.\n\n\"The Berry Systems treatment unit ... was specifically designed to treat the Cox Mill Well at the proper level,\" the DHEC's Crosby said. He did not say how, or if, the standard for daily monitoring was met.\n\nMarc Edwards, a Virginia Tech engineer and researcher who first learned of HaloSan's usage in a sampling report about Denmark, said he was \"dumbfounded\" when he saw it was being added to one of Denmark's wells.\n\n\"I did a thorough search, and I've never seen it approved for a public water supply before,\" he said. \"And the EPA approvals that I saw, none of them were for municipal potable water.\"\n\nIn addition, Edwards noted that he sees no evidence in any reports that the dosage was being regulated.\n\n\"You have to make sure you don't put too much of it in the water. And there was no way that they could prove that they weren't exceeding the recommended dose,\" he said. \"There's a maximum allowed amount, even for industrial applications. And they have no way of proving that, that level is not being exceeded.\"\n\nWilma Subra, a chemist and environmental health scientist, told CNN that HaloSan appears to be sold with a kit that regulates dosage. The state Department of Health and Environmental Control says it required daily monitoring, \"performed by the certified system operator,\" of \"any chemical\" added to the drinking water, ensuring that the maximum dosage is not exceeded.\n\nJoe Charbonnet, science and policy associate at the Green Science Policy Institute, said without knowing the concentration levels in the water, it's hard to know the health effects. He said he is concerned about HaloSan being used as a water disinfectant because it could produce compounds that are toxic.\n\nLike many small towns, Denmark's water bills have been rising since its population dropped, along with its revenue. Maintenance of old water lines has fallen victim, leaving pipes to rust and turn the water brown. It's unappealing to look at, even if the discolored water isn't violating the law.\n\nA $2 million federal grant to repair and upgrade water pipes here just wasn't enough, according to Wright, Denmark's mayor. \"[O]ne grant itself is not adequate to replace all of the necessary pipes. We prioritize the ones that should be replaced first,\" he told CNN. \"At no time have we not responded to a need that was urgent. We've done that. So what we've done is all we know we can do.\"\n\nPhotos: Residents don't trust their tap water CNN's Sara Ganim, left, with Denmark residents Eugene Smith and Paula Brown.

But in Denmark, it's not just the water pipes that are eroding -- so has trust in government officials who claimed the water was properly treated when it apparently was not.\n\nDenmark residents Paula Brown and Eugene Smith have been calling for more government oversight since their water tested high for lead in 2010. Subsequent tests were below the legal limit for lead. But, the couple says there have been concerns about skin rashes and kidney problems among residents for years, although a link has not been made directly to the water.\n\nBrown calls into the local radio station almost every day in an attempt to warn her neighbors that she doesn't believe the water is safe to drink.\n\n\"How can they say it's good to drink?,\" Smith told CNN. \"I'm not gonna drink it, and I know other people drink it, but a lot of people are drinking it because they have no other choice.\"\n\nThe couple drives 20 miles roundtrip each month to collect local spring water in cases of gallon jugs and uses that to cook, drink and brush their teeth.\n\nIn 2016, Brown saw Virginia Tech's Edwards on television, talking about the lead crisis in Flint, Michigan. Edwards has spent nearly two decades testing water and challenging federal, state and local governments on water quality, and his work helped to reveal high levels of lead in Flint's water.\n\nBrown picked up the phone and asked him to sample the water in Denmark, too.\n\nEdwards took samples at 34 homes and six other locations. Results showed that lead levels were over the legal limit in slightly more than 10 percent of those sampled. But Edwards says those findings were not high enough above the EPA's action level to sound alarm bells that there was a city-wide problem.\n\nHowever, medical experts say there is no safe level of lead in the body.\n\nSouth Carolina's DHEC tested Brown and Smith's home in 2010, and found about twice the legal level of lead in the water. When it returned to test a few months later, it found levels had dropped below the legal limit.\n\nBut, in 2011, Eugene Smith, was told by his doctor that the level of lead in his blood was high, and he should avoid his own water.\n\n\"They are not to be exposed either by ingesting nor skin exposure,\" reads a medical report that Smith shared with CNN.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Smith said. \"Because I hadn't felt like I had it in me. I got kind of upset and very angry at the time.\"\n\nDocuments from his doctor show his blood lead levels were elevated and he says he was diagnosed with partial kidney function. Although he can't say his health problem was caused by the water, he suspects it.\n\nMarc Edwards and student William Rhoads in Flint, Michigan.\n\nBut Edwards says he couldn't let go of a nagging feeling that there was something missing, especially after finding red flags, like a 2010 local newspaper story where a city official declared the water had safe lead levels nine days before the testing was conducted. Wright, Denmark's mayor, later told CNN that officials were relying on 3-year-old data when talking to the newspaper because that was what was available at the time.\n\nSkeptical of the town's transparency, Edwards decided to request to test the town's water at its source -- the drinking water wells -- for certain bacteria that might be causing some of the rashes and illness that residents described.\n\nWright wavered, and eventually, Edwards says he was denied access to the wells.\n\nWright said he had no reason to prevent Edwards from sampling. He said the state was required to do its own testing.\n\n\"I told him I thought it would be a waste of his time and resources to get the same samples,\" he told CNN. \"I guess you have to decide if you gonna believe him or believe me.\"\n\nInstead, the mayor allowed a team from the University of South Carolina to accompany state testers at the well sites, and the resulting report revealed that HaloSan was being added to the drinking water supply at one of the four wells.\n\nAfter Edwards began asking questions, the state was ordered by Clemson University, which oversees pesticide registration in South Carolina, to stop adding HaloSan to the water. The well remains offline and is not in use.\n\n\"I mean it has stopped, but what the effects that did to people who been using this water through and through?\" Eugene Smith said. \"I'm real kind of upset. People won't know until they go get tested and find what's happened to your body. Oh my god.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDenmark's mayor told CNN he believes he has done everything to make sure the water is safe.\n\n\"I live here,\" he said. \"I use water every day. Drink it. Washing in it. I would be extremely foolish if I didn't make certain it was safe. I care about myself as much as anybody cares about themselves. We have not been derelict or negligent with anything related to water. Those persons complaining, you will find out they are bogus complaints. We don't have any reason at all to provide anything less than quality water.\"\n\nA group of about 40 residents, including Smith and Brown, are now considering litigation, claiming they've been harmed by the water. They've hired Charleston, South Carolina, attorney John Harrell to represent them.\n\nHarrell tells CNN one of his clients, a 12-year-old, had to have her gall bladder removed because she had 4,000 stones in it, and another 15-year-old client had so many bladder-related illnesses that she had to have her bladder removed.\n\n\"There are so many residents that have been diagnosed with kidney dysfunction. I am convinced that there is some serious contamination,\" he said.\n\nSouth Carolina's Department of Health and Environmental Control, when asked about the potential litigation, said it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/11/health/denmark-sc-water-chemical-not-epa-approved/index.html", "published": "2018-11-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Her kidney donation now could save her granddaughter's life later", "text": "(CNN) When Meghann Adams learned that she was pregnant in early 2015, she was ecstatic. Starting a family with her husband, Chris, had not been easy, but she was carrying twins. They were to be named Delly and Aubrey.\n\nThe entire family delighted in preparing for their arrival. Adams' mom, Jamie McNeil, made plans to retire and moved across the country to help care for them.\n\n\"It was the best feeling ever,\" Adams, 35, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the family's home near Atlanta.\n\nTwenty weeks into her pregnancy, Adams had an anatomy scan, a key ultrasound in which the fetuses' development is measured. The sonographer was upbeat and pointed out all the different parts of the girls. But when the doctor came in, the tone changed.\n\nAlthough Aubrey appeared to be healthy and growing well, the ultrasound revealed cysts on one of Delly's kidneys.\n\nThe Adamses were ushered in to meet with a genetic counselor. Stats and medical terms were bandied around. The diagnosis: multicystic dysplastic kidney, which is believed to affect one in 3,500 births. It occurs when the kidney is malformed and full of cysts and, as a result, can't function. In most cases, children who have just one kidney live normal lives; the remaining kidney will take over and essentially do double duty. But in some cases, a kidney transplant might be necessary.\n\nMcNeil, the twins' grandmother, wanted to be a donor, but there was no way to know if or when Delly might need a kidney.\n\n\n\n\"It was just really overwhelming and devastating,\" Adams said. \"We were on pins and needles for a while, just really unsure.\"\n\nThe long wait for a healthy kidney\n\nDelly and Aubrey were born six weeks early, in December 2015. Because of her diagnosis, Delly was immediately taken into the neonatal intensive care unit for monitoring. \"I didn't even get to hold her the first day when she was born,\" Adam said.\n\nThose initial days were a blur. Adams was recovering from a C-section and trying to get the hang of breastfeeding.\n\nDelly was prodded and poked, her kidney monitored to make sure it was keeping up. At just 6 days old, she began to experience renal failure.\n\n\"I just didn't know how to react or what to do,\" Adams said, \"and my mind was going in a million different directions.\"\n\nDoctors began talking about dialysis and transplants, but Delly was simply too small and too young for surgery.\n\nDelly Adams in the NICU at 6 days old.\n\nSlowly, Delly's kidney began to pick up. She was in the NICU for her first month, and every day, her blood was tested.\n\nAt 3 months, Delly's blood levels were stable. But her healthy kidney hadn't grown as much as doctors had hoped by the end of her first year.\n\nHer nephrologist began talking about the potential need for a transplant -- not immediately, but maybe not so far into Delly's future.\n\n'A gift certificate for an organ'\n\nFor those in need of a kidney transplant, the wait is long. Of the nearly 100,000 people waiting for a kidney last year, only about 20% were able to find a match, according to the United Network of Organ Sharing. Finding that match took an average of three to five years.\n\nDelly's next big test will be puberty, when they'll see whether her kidney will be able to keep up with her growing body. Knowing that Delly could one day find her self on the waiting list for a kidney, Adams and her mother, McNeil, began researching options to prepare.\n\nMcNeil didn't hesitate: She dreamed of being a donor. But she's in her 50s and would probably be too old to donate by the time Delly actually needed a kidney.\n\nAnd that's how they came across an innovative new program, the National Kidney Registry's Voucher Program.\n\nEssentially, it's \"a gift certificate for an organ,\" Adams said.\n\nDonors 'waiting for their recipient'\n\nThe program began at the University of California, Los Angeles four years ago, when then-64-year-old Howard Broadman approached the UCLA Kidney Exchange Program led by transplant surgeon Dr. Jeffrey Veale with the idea of donating his kidney to a stranger now in exchange for a voucher that would potentially provide a kidney for his grandson in the future.\n\nLike Delly, Broadman's grandson, Quinn, then 4, was born with chronic kidney disease. And like McNeil, Broadman was a chronological mismatch with his grandchild -- probably too old to donate by the time the boy needed one.\n\nVeale mulled the idea over. Living donor transplants can cut wait times by years, and research has shown that that living donor kidneys tend to outlast those from deceased donors.\n\nVeale didn't want to lose out on the opportunity of a potential donor. After all, altruistic donors -- people willing to donate to complete strangers -- were key in jump-starting transplant chains that could benefit multiple patients.\n\nTransplant chains are able to take pairs of mismatched living donors and recipients and scramble them around to create chains of matching pairs. The longest chain has resulted in over 100 kidney transplants or swaps. But these chains require all donors be ready to give and recipients ready to receive at the same time.\n\nVeale decided to add Broadman to the donor pool to start a chain. In return, Quinn received a voucher that would place him at the end of a future chain once he needed a kidney.\n\n\"The voucher capitalizes on donor-recipient pairs who are chronologically incompatible,\" Veale said. \"These are patients who want to donate their kidney now but are waiting for their loved one, who doesn't quite need a kidney yet.\"\n\nAdding chronological mismatches into the donor pool only improves everyone's chances at finding a match, explained Dr. Nicole Turgeon , a transplant surgeon at Emory University and McNeil's doctor.\n\n\"It really would be in our best interest as a community to come together and have as many pairs as possible in a system to allow for the most transplants possible,\" Turgeon said.\n\nThe vouchers are all coordinated through the National Kidney Registry's living donor databases. At least 36 vouchers have been distributed, and two have been redeemed. A voucher can be activated only by the person it is initially designated for, and it expires when the voucher holder dies.\n\nThe first three \"voucher donations\" triggered 25 transplants.\n\nFor Delly and her grandmother, the voucher program was the answer.\n\n'A dream come true'\n\nMcNeil had long hoped to find a way to be an organ donor. When the retired nurse learned of a colleague who had advanced breast cancer and needed a bone marrow transplant, McNeil immediately signed up to be a bone marrow donor.\n\nShe's never been called to donate, though, and always wondered about other ways to help.\n\n\"My soul needs a connection with humanity,\" she said.\n\nThere were risks; kidney donation is still surgery. And while rare, long-term impacts can include pain, nerve damage, hernia or intestinal obstruction.\n\nNone of that dissuaded McNeil. \"I'm a nurse, so I know what all those things are. But because I'm so driven again to do it, that I just know it's the right thing to do,\" she said before the surgery. \"My soul is at peace with whatever might happen.\"\n\nJamie McNeil holds her granddaughter, Delly Adams.\n\nIn September, McNeil donated her kidney to a stranger. The donation inspired by her granddaughter triggered a chain of three other transplants. All the donor and recipient surgeries occurred on the same day, with organs criss-crossing the country.\n\n\"It's like a dream come true to me,\" McNeil said.\n\nFor McNeil, her donation is not just a gift to Delly but part of a larger mission to better what's around her.\n\n\"I wish to see more love, and so I'm going to be that love,\" she told Gupta. \"If I could inspire just three more people to donate kidneys and those three people could inspire three more people. And those three could inspire three more. If you just did that 11 times over, we would completely wipe out ... the kidney waiting list. That's doable to me.\"\n\nMcNeil said that donating a kidney would be one of the most significant days of her life.\n\n\"When I'm on my deathbed,\" she said, \"the thing I'm going to say that I'm the proudest of will probably be that day.\"\n\n'We're more similar than different'\n\nMcNeil returned home just a day after her surgery, and though she was sore, she was in the best of spirits.\n\nHer kidney had been sent to a recipient at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. A donor there sent a kidney to a recipient at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and a donor there sent one to a recipient at the Nicoletti Kidney Transplant Center at Jefferson Health in Pennsylvania. The chain ended with a final donor from Jefferson sending a kidney to a recipient at New York Presbyterian.\n\nThe news that excited McNeil most that day was to hear that her kidney had been received and was already producing urine for its new recipient.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"These chains exemplify how we're more similar than different, often matching patients of different ethnicities, religions, genders, sexuality and political affiliation. There are other benefits too, as the voucher donor helps a stranger receive a kidney today and extends the voucher donor's legacy by helping a loved one receive a kidney in the future,\" Veale said. \"We need a little more kindness in the world, and this is what these voucher donations do.\"\n\nDelly knows very little of the unique gift that her grandmother gave. All she knows is that her grandmother is a one-kidney person, like her.\n\nAnd to Delly, that doesn't mean much.

Then her newborn went into withdrawal", "text": "(CNN) The woman had used oxycodone for almost a decade but told her doctors she had been sober for two years. She never touched narcotics during her pregnancy, she said, and had completed rehab.\n\nBut her newborn son was in withdrawal: jittery, screaming and requiring an infusion of morphine to stay alive. The infant craved drugs, but why?\n\nAmid an opioid epidemic , the boy's doctors didn't blame heroin, fentanyl or other illicit substances. Instead, they said, the infant had grown dependent on a controversial herbal supplement: kratom.\n\n'A false sense of safety'\n\nAccording to a case report published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics, both the unnamed woman and her infant passed urine drug screens that looked specifically for oxycodone and other opioids. But those tests didn't look for kratom, a legal drug that has opioid-like effects at high doses.\n\nThe plant, which is native to Southeast Asia, is typically used to treat pain and curb opioid cravings. Acting on the same brain receptors as morphine and similar drugs, it is hailed by some as a solution to the opioid epidemic but derided by the US Food and Drug Administration as a potentially dangerous psychoactive drug.\n\nThe mother denied using any substances during her pregnancy -- legal or otherwise -- but her husband told doctors that she drank kratom tea daily to treat her withdrawal symptoms and help with sleep.\n\n\"I fear that women making genuine commitments to overcome their dependency may develop a false sense of safety by using a substance that is advertised as a non-opioid alternative,\" said Dr. Whitney Eldridge, a neonatologist for BayCare Health System in Florida who was lead author on the case report.\n\nThe mother might have been well-intentioned, but because tests showed no other drugs in her or the infant, her doctors said kratom probably caused her son's condition, known clinically as neonatal abstinence syndrome. On his eighth day of life, after he had been weaned off opioids and observed without any medications, the boy was discharged to his parents.\n\nIt's rare, but FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement that \"this case is not unique.\" He said the FDA \"is aware of four other cases involving neonates exposed to kratom while in utero who experienced neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome after term delivery.\"\n\nof Gottlieb, whose agency has issued a variety warnings on kratom, called the new report \"a tragic case of harm\" and said it \"further illustrates the concerns the FDA has identified about kratom, including the potential for abuse and addiction.\"\n\nAnd though Eldridge hopes more research will help lawmakers better regulate kratom, she believes that physicians today \"need to counsel women who are pregnant about the risk of kratom such as they would any other legal substance that can have ill effects on their newborn.\"\n\nExperts urge caution, cast doubt\n\nSome experts are hesitant to draw any conclusions from the report. They note that although maternal kratom use could theoretically cause neonatal abstinence syndrome, the case did not explicitly link kratom to the infant's withdrawal symptoms.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that this is possible,\" said Dr. Andrew Kruegel, an associate research scientist at Columbia University, \"because kratom certainly has opioid effects and can induce tolerance in users, especially at higher doses.\"\n\nBut Kruegel, who has studied the plant for seven years, noted that doctors weren't able to test the purported kratom itself. \"The main limitation is that we don't know anything about the dosage that the mother was taking,\" he said. \"Without that information, you can't really extrapolate too much.\"\n\nAnd the mother might not have been taking kratom at all, said Dr. Edward W. Boyer, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"It's the husband who reported the kratom use,\" he said. \"The wife who actually ingested the product, who thought it was kratom, and the authors of the case report itself, none of those people actually verified that she was ingesting kratom.\"\n\nKratom's rocky past and uncertain future\n\nDespite the FDA's warnings, kratom is easy to buy and is sometimes sold as a tea in caf\u00e9s . The nonprofit American Kratom Association estimates that 3 million to 5 million Americans use the substance, and the group says it's open to warning labels on kratom products.\n\n\"We believe that, as in many supplements, there should be a warning that pregnant women shouldn't take this,\" Dave Herman, the association's chairman, said. \"That's not because we think it's detrimental. It's because it's a safety measure.\"\n\nKratom acts on opioid receptors, which the FDA says is evidence of its potential for abuse. The agency points to 44 deaths associated with kratom, but Kruegel said that \"if you look at those 44 deaths, the vast majority of them involve other substances, including other strong opioids.\"\n\nBoyer said kratom may have other risks, such as seizures, but he noted that it might be safer than most opioids because \"there does not seem to be respiratory depression when kratom is used alone.\"\n\nRespiratory depression -- slow and ineffective breathing -- is what makes opioid overdoses so deadly. That's why Boyer believes well-regulated kratom could one day be used in the fight against opioid addiction, steering users away from more dangerous drugs.\n\n\"If you do the right thing and do the rigorous studies, then there is no reason why [kratom] shouldn't be a prescription pharmaceutical that serves as a bridge to formal drug treatment, particularly for individuals who can't get into therapy,\" Boyer said.\n\nChallenges to developing kratom-based drugs\n\nThe American Kratom Association says there's little incentive for pharmaceutical companies to study kratom as a potential prescription drug, especially because they can't patent the raw plant.\n\n\"If I'm a drug company, I think that it costs somewhere, depending on who you speak to, between $1.2 and $1.8 billion to bring a new drug to market,\" Herman said. \"Who would spend that kind of money when some other guy can just get on a boat, ride down a river and grab it off a tree?\"\n\nBecause kratom is considered a dietary supplement , manufacturers don't need FDA approval to sell it as long as their products don't claim to cure or treat specific conditions or symptoms.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut some companies have done just that, drawing the FDA's ire for saying their products could \"relieve opioid withdrawal\" or \"treat a myriad of ailments.\" The association says those cases are anomalies.\n\n\"The reality is, our belief is, this is America,\" Herman said. \"And if a product is useful for your health and well-being, you should have the right to take it, as long as it doesn't harm you. And we haven't seen any evidence of that harm.\"\n\nThe FDA, however, continues to warn against kratom, even suggesting that it could worsen the opioid epidemic.\n\n\"Kratom has never been studied in humans,\" Gottlieb said in the statement. \"What consumers and health care providers need to understand is that there are no proven medical uses for kratom. Instead, as the FDA has warned, kratom can cause serious harm and is contributing to the opioid crisis.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/07/health/kratom-tea-neonatal-abstinence-syndrome-study/index.html", "published": "2018-11-07T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Marathon runners: 4 inspiring stories from last-place finishers", "text": "(CNN) When Simon Kindleysides crossed the finish line at the Virgin Money London Marathon this year, what followed was a blur -- but he became a \"superhero\" to his kids, and he set a world record in becoming the first paralyzed man to complete the race on foot.\n\nHe was the final finisher.\n\nWhen David Fraser crossed the finish line at the TCS New York City Marathon last year, it marked his 10th time completing that race, using his toes to push his wheelchair to the finish line.\n\nHe was the final finisher.\n\nWhen Amina Abdul-Jalil crossed the finish line this year at an inaugural half-marathon in Atlanta called The Race, she never felt more proud.

MUST WATCH The history of running records 01:06\n\nThe world often hears the inspiring stories of elite athletes who finish first after running 26.2 miles in marathon races. For instance, Olympic medalist Shalane Flanagan broke the finish line tape at the New York City Marathon last year, becoming the first American woman to do so in 40 years. This year's marathon is scheduled to kick off Sunday morning.\n\nYet there are equally inspiring stories among the athletes who make up the back of the pack. As Peter Ciaccia, director of the New York City Marathon , puts it, \"for every runner, there's a story.\"\n\n\"They have their own reasons why they're doing what they're doing and they're putting in all that time and energy to train,\" he said. \"Every one of those folks that crossed the finish line are inspiring, from the first to the final finish.\"\n\nOn average, it takes bout 4\u00bd hours for men and women to complete a marathon, Ciaccia said, but that time can vary drastically among racers.\n\nIn honor of Sunday's New York City Marathon , where more than 50,000 people traveled through the five boroughs, here are four inspirational stories from the last racers in half- and full marathons.\n\nOne thing they have in common: They never gave up.\n\n'Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted'\n\nAs Simon Kindleysides, 34, took his first steps in the London Marathon in April, it felt as if magic was in the air.\n\n\"As we were walking toward the first mile, we actually started blending in with all the runners,\" he said. \"Everyone was on the streets, cheering, and that was a magical moment.\"\n\nAs time went on, the crowds and other racers dispersed. Kindleysides and his team of eight supporters continued walking.\n\nSimon Kindleysides became the first paralyzed man to complete the 2018 Virgin Money London Marathon on foot.\n\nKindleysides, who is paralyzed from the waist down and typically uses a wheelchair , was equipped with an exoskeleton to help him walk. His supporters walked with him to change the batteries in his exoskeleton so he could keep moving.\n\n\"I can walk up to four miles consecutively on one charge of the battery,\" he said.\n\nIn 2013, Kindleysides was diagnosed with a brain tumor -- a benign glioma -- that was growing in a way that pressed on certain nerves, leading to him losing feeling in his legs. He was told he would never walk again.\n\nBefore his paralysis, the London-based singer and dancer had \"always wanted to run a marathon,\" he said, but he never made the plans to do so -- until this year.\n\n\"Even when I was able-bodied, I took plenty for granted,\" Kindleysides said. \"You realize the time you wasted on things you didn't need to waste your time on.\"\n\nDuring the London Marathon, the last two miles were the hardest.\n\n\"At that point, I was exhausted. It was freezing cold, and I was hurting and emotional,\" Kindleysides said, but he kept going.\n\n\"I guess I didn't want to let people down. I had a team of eight of us, and I was raising money for The Brain Tumour Charity ,\" he said. \"I didn't want to let them down, myself down, and I thought if I'd get this far, I'd have to continue.\"\n\nSo he continued and made history as the first paralyzed man to complete the London Marathon on foot.\n\nOnce Kindleysides crossed the finish line, a live news crew interviewed him, and \"I said, 'I need a full body massage and a J\u00e4gerbomb.' I pinch myself. Why would I say that on live TV? I don't know. I wasn't really thinking,\" he said. \"My brain went mashed potato.\"\n\nThen, recovering at home, he shared his accomplishment with his three children.\n\n\"I was called RoboCop, Terminator and every superhero you can possibly imagine,\" Simon said.\n\n\"They used to say I'm the only dad in their whole school who's in a wheelchair, and now they say I'm their dad, the only one who has walked a marathon,\" he said. \"It was amazing, emotional, just to think I'd done it and to prove anything is possible. ... There's no such thing as can't.\"\n\nKindleysides is training to complete three more marathons next year, including the London Marathon again.\n\nMeanwhile, a final finisher in the United States is preparing to run his 11th New York City Marathon on Sunday.\n\n'Every year, I run the race for my wife'\n\nDavid Fraser, who was born with cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, had competed in the New York Marathon before. Racing wasn't new to him, but being the final finisher last year was -- and he enjoyed the moment.\n\nFraser said that last year he was focused on his personal training company and didn't devote as much time to training for the marathon as he normally does.\n\n\"My wife and my kids were there. They meet me at the end of my race every year, and they couldn't believe I was the last one, because I had done many races. I had done 5K, I had done half-marathons, I had even done ultras -- but never have I done that,\" said the 51-year-old New Yorker who owns a company called Nightwarriors Fitness\n\n\"But you know what? They were happy to see me complete it,\" he said of his family. \"At the start of every marathon, I have one goal -- and my goal is to complete it. I don't care about time. I care about completing the race.\"\n\nDavid Fraser at the 2016 TCS New York City Marathon. He has participated in the race every year since 2007.\n\nCerebral palsy , a group of disorders that affect muscle coordination and body movement, impacts much of Fraser's body -- but that hasn't stopped him from pursuing his love of fitness.\n\nBefore 2007, he spent much of his free time weightlifting and bodybuilding, but that year, his co-workers challenged him to run the New York Marathon. He took on the challenge and completed the race.\n\nHe has set out to finish it every year since.\n\n\"That next year, 2008, my wife developed stomach cancer, and now every year, I run the race for my wife,\" said Fraser, whose wife still attends his races.\n\nHe even developed a strategy: \"Ninety percent of the race, I do backwards,\" he said. \"Because when I go downhill, I go forward, but when I go uphill and when I do even terrain, I go backwards. ... I always run that way.\"\n\nOverall, Fraser said, \"The thing that's the most difficult part of running a marathon is not the physical. The most difficult part is the mental. The reason is because when your body gives up and you are done, really done, you now have to talk yourself back into it.\"\n\nFraser is preparing to complete the New York Marathon on Sunday, and he's looking forward to the race.\n\n\"All runners are out of their minds,\" he joked. \"Think about it. Who gets up early in the morning to run 26.2 miles? But we love it.\"\n\nAs for one runner in Atlanta, not only does she love it, it has been a \"lifesaver.\"\n\n'There's nothing I would change'\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil started running last year, around the time her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n\"I realized in that time, I don't think it was even the whole month, that I had gained 10 pounds, and I was just stressed, and I thought, 'I need to do something now, or this isn't going to end well,' \" Abdul-Jalil said.\n\nSo she joined a running group called Black Girls Run\n\n\"To be completely honest, it's been a lifesaver in a very real way, because I have major depressive disorder ,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Exercise may help reduce depression Replay More Videos ...

Then she saw a video clip of ultramarathon runner Mirna Valerio , a runner with a body type similar to her own.\n\n\"I was like, 'she runs like me' -- and that was a big moment for me,\" Abdul-Jalil said. \"So I was like 'maybe, maybe, maybe I could pull this off.' \"\n\nThen she registered for The Race and trained for 12 weeks.\n\nJUST WATCHED Runner leads the way for overweight athletes Replay More Videos ...

Watching her finish the race is what inspired me to seek out the stories of final finishers. She told me that she ran the race simply to see whether she could do it.\n\n\"Running is something that I didn't think I'd ever be able to do because I was a kid with horrible asthma,\" said the 41-year-old mother, who lives in the Atlanta area.\n\n\"And I'm not FloJo-built,\" she added, referencing late track-and-field athlete Florence Griffith-Joyner , who holds the 100-meter and 200-meter dash world records for women.\n\nAmina Abdul-Jalil was the final finisher at the 2018 The Race half-marathon in Atlanta.\n\nOver the 13.1-mile course, Abdul-Jalil listened to a playlist that included songs like Twenty One Pilots' \"Ride\" and Outkast's \"B.O.B.\"\n\nAround mile three, a medical director approached her, indicating that her pace was such that the finish line might close before she got there. If that were to happen, Abdul-Jalil might not receive medical assistance if she needed it, the medical director said.\n\nIn that moment, Abdul-Jalil felt discouraged.\n\n\"I wanted to cry and quit, and it took maybe another two miles to get that out of my head,\" she said. To keep her going, she thought about the running group, Black Girls Run.\n\n\"I literally went back to conversations that I've had,\" she said. \"Every time I said I can't do something, there was at least one or two other people that said I could.\"\n\nSo she kept going.\n\nJUST WATCHED \"Black girls run\" organize to fight obesity Replay More Videos ...

They even posted a live video of her finish on Facebook , to celebrate her as the last runner.\n\nA couple of days later, Abdul-Jalil watched the video, which has gotten more than 2,000 views.\n\nWith her depression, Abdul-Jalil sometimes replays sad experiences or picks apart moments in her life -- but after watching the video of her finish, \"that's one external replay or something that has happened in my life where I don't pick it apart,\" she said. \"There's nothing I would change.\"\n\nBefore the race, \"I had given myself a really hard time -- 'Oh, my God, what if I'm the last person?' -- and now it's something that I would do again,\" she said. \"You don't have to fit X mold to be great and to be celebrated. It's validating.\"\n\nBeing the final finisher is something that one runner in London not only would do again, but has done 25 times.\n\n'It's not about the time you do but the time you have'\n\nLisa Jackson loves being the last runner.\n\n\"When you're last, it's a sense of occasion. People really admire you for your grit when getting there,\" she said.\n\nJackson, 51, was \"incredibly unathletic\" as a child and ran her first marathon when she was 31.\n\n\"After the indescribable feeling of accomplishment and joy, I thought, 'I have to experience this feeling every year, at least once,' \" she said, and so she set out to run at least one marathon annually.\n\nLisa Jackson, at the 2013 Verona Marathon in Italy, has run 110 marathons and ultramarathons.\n\n\"When I first started running, my biggest fear was coming last,\" Jackson said. \"And it was actually my 31st marathon -- the South Downs Marathon -- when I was the final finisher for the first time.\"\n\nJackson ran the South Downs trail marathon in the UK in June 2012. The course was hilly, the summer heat was grueling, and she wanted to give up -- but she kept running.\n\nJackson realized that she was the last runner when she saw a man on a bicycle taking down the distance markers along the course, she said. They spoke as she continued on her way, and she made a friend.\n\nNext thing she knew, she was approaching the finish line, where other runners and race organizers gave her a standing ovation.\n\n\"I no longer have any fear of coming last, and if there's a risk of coming second to last, I try to drop back a little to ensure I'm in last place as we cross the line,\" Jackson said.\n\nAfter all, in that moment on the South Downs, she realized that when runners are not stressed about their time, the people they can encounter and the relationships that form can make a race that much more worthwhile.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"My philosophy with running is that it's not about the time you do but the time you have,\" said Jackson, who went on to run the New York, Boston, London, Chicago and Rome marathons, among dozens of others.\n\n\"I think it's really funny when people feel sorry for me for coming in last. ...

Laura and Anthony Sidari's 4-year-old son, Leon, did not get the flu vaccine last year. He died on Christmas Day, less than 48 hours after he started feeling sick.\n\n\"I didn't know a condition could kill a child that quickly who had been previously healthy,\" said Laura, a psychiatrist. \"This has been a hard haul for us, and we're very private people, but we're trying to help other families.\"\n\nLeon was one of 185 US children who died in the 2017-18 flu season, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- a historic high.\n\nApproximately 80% of those children had not received a flu shot, according to the CDC.\n\nLaura and Anthony, a rheumatologist, had wanted to get Leon and his 2-year-old brother flu shots at a pharmacy. They lived in Texas, where state law prohibits pharmacists from vaccinating anyone under the age of 7.\n\nThe Sidaris with sons Cameron and Tristan after getting flu shots this fall.\n\nThe couple, busy with their newborn third child, Cameron, decided to get Leon a flu shot when they were going to the pediatrician anyway: when 2-year-old Tristan had his annual visit, scheduled for January 3.\n\nLeon died 10 days before that appointment.\n\n\"It wasn't even on my radar as something that I really, really needed to prioritize,\" Laura said. \"It just slipped through the cracks.\"\n\nThe Sidaris' story is all too familiar to Dr. Flor Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nFor 20 years, Mu\u00f1oz, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, has worked with the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase the rate of flu vaccination for children.\n\nThe rates aren't great: Only 47.8% of children 6 months to 17 years old have had a flu shot in the previous year, according to the CDC , which recommends that everyone over 6 months get a flu shot.\n\nThe problem: Though adults can get flu shots at pharmacies or even at work, children don't have as many options.\n\nLeon Sidari died 10 days before his flu shot appointment.\n\nIn most states, there are limits or outright bans on pharmacists vaccinating children, and flu vaccine clinics at schools are the exception rather than the rule.\n\nOnly 13 states allow pharmacists to vaccinate children of any age, according to the National Association of State Pharmacy Associations.\n\n\"It's frustrating. It seems like we don't learn,\" Mu\u00f1oz said.\n\nThere's no medical reason children shouldn't get flu shots at a pharmacy, said Mu\u00f1oz, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\nSome states are changing their laws. New York used to bar pharmacists from giving flu shots to anyone under 18. This year, after the historic flu season, the state changed its laws to permit vaccination for anyone 2 or older.\n\n\"Good for you, New York!\" Mu\u00f1oz said. \"More should be done to make this happen in other states. There should be more of a push.\"\n\nDr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said more should also be done to make it easier for local health departments to offer flu shot clinics.

Flu activity can peak in December, and holiday get-togethers can make the virus spread more quickly. It takes about two weeks for the shot to become effective after you receive it.\n\n\"Leon is my reason this season, and every season, for getting flu shots on time,\" Laura Sidari wrote on her Facebook page. \"Holiday planning and fall festivities can wait, but the flu shot cannot.\"\n\nCNN's John Bonifield and Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this story.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/02/health/sidari-flu/index.html", "published": "2018-11-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "This teen's body was 'bending by the hour.' His 18th surgery changed his life", "text": "(CNN) John Sarcona was at a baseball game when his mother Joanne found the bloodied T-shirts in his laundry hamper. His bedding was bloody too, and she knew something had gone terribly wrong.\n\n\"I told myself that this can't be happening,\" Joanne said. \"I'm putting two and two together, and I'm trying to get a hold of John. Nobody is answering my calls or texts, and I'm frantic, my mind is running.\"\n\nJohn, now 19, had been diagnosed at age 5 with what would become an extreme case of scoliosis and kyphosis. He'd already had 16 surgeries, with doctors placing metal implants along his spine to support his back as he grew.\n\nWhen the 16-year-old finally came home after his mother noticed the bloody clothes, Joanne took him upstairs and calmly asked, \"John, can you take off your shirt?\"\n\nJohn Sarcona and his mother, Joanne, when he was 6 years old.\n\nWhat she saw still haunts her: metal rods protruding from her son's back. They had broken before, requiring additional surgeries to repair, but this was different. \"They looked like cysts and tumors on John's back,\" she remembers.\n\nWithin a few weeks, John was back in the hospital for his 17th surgery to remove them once and for all, and the recovery was grueling.\n\n\"Every 15 minutes,\" Joanne said, \"the nurses would tell John to take deep breaths. But he'd say to them, 'I can't. I'm in pain. How can I keep my oxygen levels at 99% if I'm dying here?'\"\n\n\"I can't do this anymore,\" John told his mom, ripping off his pulse oximeter. \"I want to go home.\"\n\nA lifetime of struggle\n\nWhen he was 6 years old, John was told to wear a brace for 22 hours a day, taking it off only to shower.\n\nJohn Sarcona as a young boy, before his severe scoliosis developed.\n\nHis mother decorated the brace with stickers and his classmates signed it with their names. But even in elementary school, John felt different. \"I wouldn't want to be around my friends with it on,\" he said. \"It was just so annoying.\"\n\nScoliosis, the curving of the spine from side to side, affects about 2% to 3% percent of the population, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. Kyphosis is the bending of the spine forward in the upper back -- leading to a hunchback appearance. Bracing is a common treatment for both conditions in children.\n\nBut for all its inconvenience, the brace did little to help John's worsening spine. He needed surgery, doctors said, and he soon had the operation to insert the rods into his back. Every six months, John returned to the hospital to lengthen them as he grew.\n\nBut after 17 operations, those rods were gone -- and John's condition was as bad as ever.\n\n\"It's important to understand that surgery can do a lot,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Wang, president of the North American Spine Society and co-director of the USC Spine Center. \"But surgery can't do everything. It's not always the fault of the kid or the doctor or the patient if it fails.\"\n\nJohn's surgeon, unable to treat him any further, recommended Dr. Lawrence Lenke, surgeon-in-chief at the Daniel and Jane Och Spine Hospital at NewYork-Presbyterian and a former president of the Scoliosis Research Society.\n\n\"Part of my practice is taking care of things that other people can't take care of,\" said Lenke. \"Some surgeons, at some point, are not comfortable treating these conditions.\"\n\n'How do I trust you?'\n\nJohn's condition continued to worsen after he returned home from his rod removal. When the family went to NewYork-Presbyterian a month later, Lenke said that John was \"bending by the hour.\"\n\nJoanne was wary of any more procedures. Her son had been under the knife so often that doctors had trouble closing his skin after operations.\n\n\"She was a little terrified of any more surgeries,\" Lenke said, \"because none of them seemed to work. Her direct words were, 'I trusted a surgeon for so long. How do I trust you?'\n\nIndeed, Joanne remembers, \"I didn't trust him at first. And I ask for forgiveness every day for that. But there was no other option, and the surgery had to be done.\"\n\nJohn's kyphosis, an outward curvature of his spine that hunched his back, was so severe that it impacted his breathing, leaving him with only 22% of his lung capacity when he arrived at NewYork-Presbyterian. \"Walking through school, even from one end to the other, I'd be out of breath,\" John remembered. \"It was definitely a struggle.\"\n\nHe needed surgery, but Lenke's proposal was risky -- a slight complication and John could have been paralyzed for life.\n\nCalled a vertebral column resection, Lenke would separate John's spine into different sections, remove two vertebrae at the very center of the severe kyphosis, then straighten the spine as he brought the pieces back together.\n\n\"It does work well,\" Lenke said, \"but the issue is that we have to take the vertebra out around the spinal cord, and that's risky.\" His mother was terrified, but John had few options.\n\n\"The risk of doing nothing was that her son was going to suffocate or die,\" Lenke said, \"and she could see that slowly happening.\"\n\nA moment of terror before 'a new chance at life'\n\nThe surgery was a harrowing one. For 13 hours, Lenke operated on John with a spinal fellow and a scrub nurse as other staff rotated in and out of the operating room. Not everything went according to plan.\n\n\"We test electrical activity,\" Lenke said, \"and in the middle of taking a vertebrate out, the spinal cord activity went away.\"\n\nThat isn't unheard of -- Lenke said it happens in about 30% of surgeries like John's -- but \"for an hour, he was technically paralyzed.\"\n\nLenke powered through the surgery, working quickly to remove pressure from the spinal cord, and John emerged from the operation with no complications.\n\n\"The doctors were soaking wet in their scrubs from top to bottom,\" said Joanne. \"They were completely exhausted. They never stopped working, and they saved my son's life.\"\n\nJohn Sarcona before his surgery, left, and after. Doctors at NewYork-Presbyterian performed a complex two-level vertebral column resection.\n\nThe top of John's spine had been bent forward over 120 degrees before his surgery, making it difficult to stand straight up and perform daily tasks like walking up stairs.\n\n\"I was collapsing on myself,\" John said. His operation was so drastic that it changed his body's center of gravity.\n\n\"Those first steps, leaning up against the bed, I felt like I was in a new body,\" John said. \"It's a pretty crazy feeling and I still remember it today. It was almost like learning how to walk again.\"\n\nIt was his 18th surgery, but things felt different this time. \"This might be a chance at a new life,\" he remembers thinking. \"I could feel myself getting stronger with each step.\"\n\nFrom the operating room to the golf course\n\nA year later, John graduated high school and attended his senior prom.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"I was just praying everyday for a miracle to happen, that I would be able to see my son graduate,\" said Joanne.

Her grit shows immediately, not just from when she walks, but also when she talks.\n\n\"Paralysis isn't in my dictionary.\"\n\n\"Don't call me handicapped, because I'm not.\"\n\n\"Thank God, I was raised cowboy tough.\"\n\nIt takes several minutes for her to walk the 40 feet from her car to the tree. Every step is worth it: Today is about triumph rather than a search for lost memories.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" she says. \"It does feel good to be standing where I thought my life ended.\"\n\nShe woke in a hospital a couple of weeks after the accident, with tubes and wires seemingly hooked up to everything. At 19, she was paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nThomas stands next to the red maple where the truck she was driving came to a halt. \"The stimulator is facilitating my movement,\" she says, \"but my strength is coming from within.\"\n\nShe told her neurosurgeon she would walk again, no matter how slim the odds. He left the room and told her mother not to \"go chasing something that's never going to happen.\"\n\nThe journey has been in no way easy.\n\nThere were tears and screaming fits. In moments of desperation, she would say to God, \"I don't know why this has happened, but if you can help me to understand this, it might make it a little easier.\"\n\nShe had planned to become a physical therapist to help others. Her mission changed that fateful July day. She's now helping others by taking steps and speaking up.\n\nThe trunk of the red maple still bears scars from the crash, with chunks of bark missing from when truck and tree met.\n\nAs she stands next to the tree, Thomas searches for the words to describe her emotions. \"It's somewhere between 'I told you so' and the impossible,\" she says. \"Somewhere between possible and impossible.\n\n\"Being here gives me a sense of power, because I lost a life here. But I also gained a brand new one. And I'm proud of the new life I have.\"\n\nTransforming the spinal cord injury field\n\nThomas is part of innovative research conducted at the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center at the University of Louisville.\n\nIn a study published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine, two of four patients with \"motor complete spinal cord injury\" -- meaning no voluntary movement below their injury -- were able to walk again after being implanted with a spinal cord stimulation device and then undergoing extensive physical therapy. They walk with the aid of walkers.\n\nThomas became paralyzed at the age of 19. Always active in life, she made a pledge to herself that she'd walk again, no matter the odds.\n\n\"This should change our thinking about people with paralysis,\" said Susan Harkema, one of the lead researchers on the project and a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery at the University of Louisville. \"It's phenomenal. This new knowledge is giving us the tools to develop new strategies and tools for recovery in people with chronic spinal injuries.\"\n\nClaudia Angeli, the other lead researcher and a senior researcher at the Human Locomotion Research Center at Frazier Rehab Institute in Louisville, said it's a fascinating time to be involved in spinal cord research, bringing together decades of investigations culminating in modern-day breakthroughs.\n\n\"It just shows the capacity of the spinal cord and how much we're learning about using the epidural stimulation in combination with therapy,\" Angeli said.\n\n14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents. Over the years , their research has involved14 paralyzed people who have received what is called an epidural stimulator implanted over a portion of the lower spinal cord, enabling neurons below their injuries to receive signals the brain used to send before their accidents.\n\nAll 14 patients have experienced voluntarily movement with the implant, the researchers said. They also showed improvement in bowel and bladder function.\n\nThe latest study focused on four patients, including Thomas who underwent therapy twice a day for five days a week for many months. A morning therapy session would involve working on stepping; an afternoon session would focus on standing. Thomas's therapy lasted 10 months after receiving the implant.\n\nThomas says she has to focus on every step to walk. Sometimes, she talks to her feet to keep them moving.\n\nAll four were able to stand independently, and two were able to walk over ground, the researchers said. One patient fractured his hip, setting his therapy back by several months, the researchers said.\n\nThe other patient who was able to walk over ground had been paralyzed from his neck down with no ability to move his arms until he received the stimulator. \"With the stimulator off,\" Angeli said, \"he can't even sit up.\"\n\nHarkema and Angeli said they believe the positive results were the combination of the stimulation and improved physical therapy treatment.\n\nHarkema underwent a federal investigation a couple years ago. Certain research activities were determined to be in violation of federal regulations, according to a letter from the Department of Health and Human Services in 2016. The letter states the University of Louisville took adequate corrective actions to address the noncompliance. Harkema says she stands by her work.\n\nWhat's it like to see people who are paralyzed walk again?\n\n\"I draw inspiration from every person with a spinal cord injury who comes into this program,\" Harkema said. \"They each have their own unique personalities and spirits. They are just pioneers.\"\n\nAdding to the excitement of these advancements, another study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine unveiled similar results. A man paralyzed since 2013 regained his ability to stand and walk with assistance due to spinal cord stimulation and physical therapy, according to research done in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThomas uses a walker with front wheels. She says her top goal now is ditch the walker one day.\n\n\"What this is teaching us is that those networks of neurons below a spinal cord injury still can function after paralysis,\" Dr. Kendall Lee, the co-principal investigator and director of Mayo Clinic's Neural Engineering Laboratories, said in a press release.\n\nThere have been other cases in recent years in which paralyzed people have risen from their wheelchairs and walked. One study in 2015 and another in 2016 showed success in using rehabilitation combined with what is called \"brain-computer interface,\" in which brain signals were sent to an electrical stimulator or exoskeleton resulting in the generation of muscle activity, allowing some patients to walk.\n\n\"They're different in terms of the way to activate the central nervous system, but the overall outcome is similar,\" said Monica Perez, a professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery with the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami.\n\nMonday's studies, Perez said, provide important additional evidence to the continued advances being made in the spinal cord injury field. She said it shows more proof that people with severe paralysis often have residual connections that \"can be engaged in a functionally relevant manner -- and that's amazing.\"\n\n\"What the studies demonstrate is that those connections in the central nervous system can still be recruited, even though you have an injury from years ago,\" said Perez, who was not connected to either study.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view, she said, an important consequence of the studies is the awareness \"that we need to work harder to understand how we can better involve those connections,\" she said. \"These people with more severe paralysis are regaining this level of function -- and that is beautiful. We also need more accurate assessments of our patients.\"\n\n\"It's not the first time an individual with severe clinically complete paralysis has walked with assistive technology without the help of a therapist,\" she said. \"But it's tremendously important that in more cases the potential of these approaches can be demonstrated.\"\n\nHarkema and Angeli, whose study was funded in part by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, said it's imperative for stakeholders to come together to fund more research to help as many of the 1.2 million people with paralysis. More than 8,000 have expressed interest in being research participants in their program.\n\nFor Thomas, it's even more personal. She wants others with injuries as severe as hers to experience the transformation she's gone through.\n\n\"Nothing's going to be able to stop me in life, because I took something that was thought to be impossible, and I turned it into possible,\" she says.\n\n'Way too many things to do'\n\nSince she was a child, Thomas has loved to ride horses. She'd saddle up her horse Shadow and take off across the family's ranch. At rodeos, she and Shadow were inseparable.\n\n\"All you need is love and a horse,\" the motto next to her bed says.\n\nIn her late teens, she would run 3 to 4 miles a day, train horses and do endurance weight training at the gym almost every day. She worked as a waitress while attending college to become a physical therapist.\n\nAll of that was shattered in an instant. The young woman who had been so active was now confined to a chair at the age of 19. It was a fate she could not accept.\n\nThomas still rides her horse Shadow, but she needs assistance getting on. Her goal is to be able to saddle Shadow herself and hop on with no help.\n\nNot only had she lost her ability to walk, she'd lost bladder control and sexual function. If she went outside, her body temperature would skyrocket over 101 degrees because it could no longer regulate itself. Every bit of her independence, she felt, had been stripped.\n\n\"I was lying there saying, 'there is no way I can sit in this chair the rest of my life,' \" she says. \"I have way too many things to do.\"\n\nTo walk again, she'd have to \"cowboy up,\" as she puts it. She'd rely on the toughness instilled in her by her father from working on the ranch.\n\nIt would push her to the limits, at times leaving her on the floor crying, wanting to quit. She'd heard about the program in Louisville. She first went for a screening in January 2017. She returned a month later and stayed through May to do physical therapy, working on standing and stepping for an hour every day.\n\nThe stimulator would require a major surgery and a commitment to stay in Louisville for at least a year. She wrestled with the decision. She talked with several men who had the stimulator. They had made gains after the implant, but at the time, no one had walked. She thought, \"what's the point of going through so much work?\"\n\n\"Just being able to stand or wiggle my toes,\" she says, \"was not enough for me.\"\n\nThomas's room is decked out with horse mementos from her days at the rodeo.\n\nOne of her sisters spoke with her. She told Thomas that she didn't want her to wonder \"what if\" for the rest of her life. No one knew what Thomas' decision would be.\n\nOn August 5, 2017, the family's vehicle was loaded up. \"Are we going?\" her father asked.\n\nThey drove the 13 hours to Louisville. The stimulator was implanted the next month.\n\nSensation swept through her body as soon as it was turned on.\"There was this rushing vibration,\" she says. \"It was like a highlighter of my muscles. All of them were contracting. It was wild.\"\n\nThe real work lay in the months ahead. She had endured physical therapy sessions three times a week for three years prior to the implant. That helped set her on a path for success, she says, but it was nothing close to how hard the work over the next year would be. She attended physical therapy fives times a week, a couple of hours every day.\n\nShe clung to her faith during the most agonizing sessions, repeating phrases to herself: \"I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me\" and \"God is with me. I will not fail.\"\n\n\"I tell you what: After the implant, I was introduced to a whole new ballgame,\" she says. \"The hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life. I prayed my way through so many sessions, just to get me through, because I wanted to quit.\"\n\nThomas says growing up on her family's ranch made her tough and prepared her for the journey.\n\nThe stimulator does not move her legs for her. It stimulates neurons and nerves, allowing her to consciously control the movement.\n\nIt began small -- wiggling of toes -- then one leg being able to move and then figuring out how to sync her legs to be able to walk.\n\nShe was wearing a black T-shirt with the phrase \"No Days Off\" on that magical day in February. She took a step or two, and then her therapist broke out in dance. The two hugged and cried. \"Oh, my God,\" Thomas said.\n\nShe wiped away the tears and took more steps.\n\nIt was like trying to pat your tummy and rub your head at the same time, she says explaining how it felt trying to coordinate her legs, body and mind.\n\n\"Trying to trust my body, trying to find a cadence, was very hard.\"\n\nFinding her calling\n\nThomas can now walk and talk at the same time, but she still must focus on each step.\n\nShe presses a device against her abdomen to turn the stimulator on. \"I'm still paralyzed as can be without it,\" she says.\n\nTo turn her stimulator on, Kelly uses a magnet hooked up to this device and presses it against her abdomen.\n\nWhen she stands, she asks herself, \"How do I walk, again?\"\n\nBeyond helping her walk, the stimulator has restored sexual function and much of her bladder control. She has regained muscle mass, and nerve pain in her right foot has disappeared. \"I'm totally pro stimulator. I love it,\" she says.\n\nStrolling across her front lawn at the family ranch, she says that her No. 1 goal in the short term is to get rid of her walker. She'd love to be able to run again.\n\nShe points to the nearby barn that houses Shadow. She longs to be able to walk to the barn by herself, saddle her up and get on. She'd longs to get Shadow in a full gallop again.\n\n\"That's the day I'll accept that I'm healed,\" she says.\n\nFor now, she's taking every day one stride at a time. She says her story is not about herself; it's about helping others. She's buoyed by messages of support from friends and strangers alike. She says it's for them that she works so hard.\n\nIn town, that encouragement is on full display.\n\n\"I just want to tell you congratulations, sweetie. You're doing beautiful,\" a woman tells her outside the Homosassa Public Library.\n\nA man in a pickup sees her struggling at her car. \"Need some help?\" he asks.\n\n\"No, sir,\" she responds. \"I've got it.\"\n\nThomas stands at the spot where she was left paralyzed in 2014. She said it was empowering to be able to walk and stand at the scene.\n\nShe exemplifies a fierce determination like few others. Through her struggle, she's found her calling. Being around her, one can't help but be inspired. She rattles off an array of powerful messages.\n\n\"Even if I can't physically help people like I initially intended to do, I can dang sure encourage, help and motivate.\"\n\n\"I carry on with my life like nobody's business, even if my legs aren't working so great.\"\n\n\"The stimulator is facilitating my movement, but my strength is coming from within.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThat strength is what's gotten her this far. Her 19-year-old brother, Sam, sums it up in cowboy speak: \"There's nothing she can't do. That's for sure.\"\n\nHe lifts his sister onto Shadow. Kelly and Shadow trot around the front yard. She doesn't know when, but she says one day, she'll hop on without her brother's help.\n\n\"I don't have a time frame,\" she says, \"but I have physical goals to get me there.\"\n\nThe moral of her story, she says, is never underestimate a cowboy.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/24/health/paralyzed-woman-walks-again/index.html", "published": "2018-09-24T00:00:00"}, {"title": "While America wages war on opioids, meth makes its comeback", "text": "(CNN) For Capt. Mark Wollmershauser Jr. and the Tulsa Police Department, the late-2000s and early 2010s were an extremely dangerous time.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a state that is no stranger to the scourge of methamphetamine addiction, those years were the heyday of the \"shake and bake\" method -- a rudimentary way of making meth using just cold medicine, some toxic chemicals and an empty two-liter bottle.\n\nThe technique is simple enough that many addicts can cook their own meth, but with one tiny misstep, the chemical reaction that occurs inside can cause deadly explosions\n\nBy 2011, Wollmershauser and his narcotics unit were finding and dismantling hundreds of these vessels in meth labs around the city.\n\nA display of items used in the \"shake-and-bake\" method of manufacturing methamphetamine is shown in Oklahoma City. The items shown were purchased for display purposes.\n\n\"People were not just burning themselves while cooking meth but were causing damage to other residents that had nothing to do with methamphetamine,\" he said. \"It was a really horrible time.\"\n\nWhen new laws were enacted to limit access to pseudoephedrine -- an allergy drug used in making meth -- the proliferation of these mobile labs waned. After responding to a high of 431 meth labs in 2011, his department encountered just 19 last year.\n\nBut Wollmershauser said that didn't spell the end of Tulsa's meth problem. In fact, officials across the state say they are seizing meth that is purer, cheaper and in greater quantities than ever before, with most of it coming from south of the border.\n\nAnd while much of America is focused on combating the devastating impacts of opioid addiction, some states like Oklahoma are struggling to fight a new battle against an old foe.\n\nThe role of Mexican 'superlabs'\n\nRichard Salter has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 27 years, most recently as the special agent in charge for the state of Oklahoma.\n\nHe said the meth problem in Oklahoma is getting worse, and points to Mexican cartels -- in particular, the powerful Sinaloa cartel -- as the reason.\n\nAs it became more difficult and dangerous to produce meth in the United States, cartels recognized an opportunity to fill the void.\n\n\"They came in with much purer, much cheaper meth and just flooded this region of the country,\" Salter said.\n\nA Mexican Army expert stands near containers with crystal meth paste at a clandestine laboratory in Mexico's Baja California state. \"Superlabs\" like this one can produce hundreds of pounds of crystal meth daily.\n\nSalter said in 2012, the DEA was buying meth undercover off the streets for $1,100 an ounce. Today, his agents are regularly getting ounces for just $250 to $450.\n\n\"That's as cheap as I have ever seen methamphetamine my entire career,\" he said.\n\nThe reason for the drop in prices is the scale of production that the Mexican cartels have achieved. Whereas \"shake and bake\" labs could turn out lots of small batches, so-called \"superlabs\" in Mexico produce hundreds of pounds daily.\n\nSalter said most of the meth his agents seize first comes across the US-Mexico border in California or Arizona, before making its way through the interstate highway system and temporary stash houses on its way to Oklahoma.\n\nAlong the border, officials with US Customs and Border Protection also report a steep increase in the amount of meth they are seizing.\n\nAnne Maricich, deputy director of field operations for the agency's San Diego ports of entry, said her field office has seen a 50% increase in the amount of meth seized compared to this time last year.\n\n\"The other hard narcotics like cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, we see them -- they're prevalent at our border crossings, but nowhere near the quantities that we see of meth,\" she said.\n\nOn the streets of Oklahoma, this influx of cheap and powerful meth has had deadly consequences.\n\nThe number of lethal meth overdoses in the state has more than doubled in recent years, rising from 140 in 2012 to 335 deaths in 2016. In 2017, there were 327 meth overdose deaths, but that tally is incomplete and the actual number is likely higher, according to Mark Woodward, spokesman with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics.\n\n\"There's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis,\" said Woodward. \"But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.\"\n\nPerhaps no city has been hit harder by this latest meth epidemic than Tulsa.\n\nIn just the first six months of 2018, Wollmershauser said his Special Investigations Division has already surpassed the amount of meth they seized in all of 2017 by 30 pounds.\n\nHe can't explain why the problem is more severe here than in other parts of the state, but he doesn't think incarceration is the solution.\n\nThere's so much attention -- not just in Oklahoma, but nationwide -- on the opioid crisis. But our single most deadly individual drug is methamphetamine.\n\nWollmershauser said his department is trying to use more \"front end diversion\" tactics to help addicts get treatment without getting the criminal justice system involved, while also aggressively pursuing the cartels and other large-scale distributors.\n\nWhile the amount of meth his officers has seized has risen, he said his department is on track to reduce the number of arrests by 40% this year.\n\n\"I think we're definitely targeting the right folks that are taking advantage of our city and citizens, but the addiction is strong and it's difficult,\" Wollmershauser said.\n\nHow meth fueled a crisis behind bars\n\nLindsay McAteer's struggles with anxiety and depression led her to self-medicate as a teenager.\n\nAt age 14, her boyfriend at the time introduced her to meth.\n\n\"I immediately liked it,\" McAteer said. \"It gave me a false sense of identity and a false sense of accomplishment.\"\n\nIt was the beginning of a 20-year struggle with the drug that nearly ended with a life sentence.\n\nI was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.\n\nAfter using meth for several years, she said she stopped for a brief period, but after she was laid off from work and had her house foreclosed on, her addiction spiraled out of control.\n\n\"I had nothing,\" McAteer said. \"I was losing everything, and meth was able to make me feel like everything was OK, despite the fact that nothing was OK.\"\n\nIn addition to using meth, McAteer began selling the drug. She was eventually arrested for trafficking and found herself staring at a possible sentence of 12 years to life.\n\nJUST WATCHED The total chaos of meth addiction Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The total chaos of meth addiction 00:56\n\nBut even for those like McAteer who face time in prison, there are sometimes alternatives to a life behind bars. Women in Recovery , or WIR, is an intensive program for women who are looking at lengthy sentences for drug offenses in Tulsa County.\n\nWith the door of a prison cell the only other option that was open to her, McAteer entered WIR in August 2014.\n\nMimi Tarrasch, the executive senior director for WIR, said that many of the program's participants are multi-substance users, but at least 60% have seen their addictions lead them to meth.\n\n\"Early on, because it's a stimulant, they feel wonderful and it makes them productive and motivated,\" said Roxanne Hinther, clinical director for WIR. \"But ultimately, they can't take care of their children and they lose everything they have.\"\n\nI can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment.\n\nTarrasch said that most of the women in her program have been battling addiction for 13 to 15 years, which takes a huge toll on their health and wellness, and that of their family. Many have also experienced traumatic events, from childhood abuse to sexual assaults and domestic violence.\n\nUsing a range of treatments, training and education, the program gives women who would be spending time behind bars a second chance at a productive and fulfilling life.\n\nMcAteer graduated from WIR in 2016 and has now been in active recovery for more than four years. Today, she works as a housing compliance specialist for the Mental Health Association Oklahoma.\n\nSince Women in Recovery began in 2009, 390 women have graduated, with 6.7% of graduates relapsing or falling back into criminal activity.\n\n\"I can say that recovery is definitely possible, and I can say that treatment is the answer versus punishment,\" McAteer said. \"It's not foolproof -- I can't say that everyone is able to use this [program] the way it's designed to work, but the vast majority of us do.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/meth-overdoses-increase-oklahoma-mexico-superlabs/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Decades after their own sexual assaults, women put themselves in shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers", "text": "(CNN) Her Catholic boyfriend said he was waiting until marriage to have sex, so she felt safe. But after she passed out fully clothed on prom night, she woke up naked with him on top of and inside her. She got pregnant that night, 36 years ago, and he paid for her abortion. Then he mailed a letter to tell her she was going to hell.\n\nFive drunken frat boys piled on top of a college sophomore, who was sober, as the party's loud music drowned out her screams in the dark room. They grabbed at and groped her. One of them penetrated her with his finger before she broke free and ran.\n\nA 19-year-old studying abroad woke up to a young man fondling her and masturbating in her face. An older boy plied a 15-year-old with booze and, after she passed out at a house party, stole her virginity. Another young woman took the cocktail a cute guy offered on her 21st birthday. She didn't know what to call it when the same guy had his way with her after she grew woozy, they left the bar and her body went numb. More than a decade later, when a friend of friends assaulted her, dislocated her jaw and left her bruised, she knew the word: rape.\n\nThese are just a sampling of the dozens of stories of sexual assault that were shared with me in recent days by phone, email and through social media. They are accounts from women in their 30s, 40s and 50s who I asked to reflect on their younger years, mostly in high school and college. They spoke out on the condition that they, and the accused, would remain anonymous.\n\nSome called their sexual assaults a \"clich\u00e9,\" perhaps too common to be worth mentioning. One woman simply quipped, \"Is there a woman who made it through college without this experience?\"\n\nWith decades-old allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by Judge Brett Kavanaugh making headlines and threatening to derail his Supreme Court nomination, we've entered a new chapter in the #MeToo movement. Women are thinking back to their own experiences, many of them for the first time in years. They're talking about their assaults online, in their homes and at dinner parties.\n\nWhat are these stories stirring up in women? Are they putting themselves in the shoes of Kavanaugh's accusers? And do they think they could or would come forward themselves if the men who assaulted them were suddenly poised for positions of power?\n\n'Every scream I never screamed'\n\nPlenty of those I heard from spent years blaming themselves and few, if they knew who their attackers were, reported anything to authorities or other adults, including parents. Those who did learned quickly why most girls and women don't . They weren't believed, felt ashamed and didn't see justice served. They were fed the \"boys will be boys\" line, even by their mothers.\n\nSome had never shared their stories before; others only with select family members or friends.\n\nThere were those who were relatively unscathed by their experiences. Others were not so fortunate and have years of therapy behind them to prove it. One woman said she dropped out of college for a year and couldn't have an intimate relationship for eight years after her rape. The one who lost her virginity against her will at 15 listed off a series of subsequent assaults and spent much of her adult life struggling with low self-esteem and trying not to \"feel like a slut.\"\n\nThe last time she was assaulted, she was nearly 40. She was walking through a park in broad daylight when a man approached from behind, thrust his hand up her skirt and grabbed her crotch.\n\n\"At first I froze, but then I started to scream,\" she said. \"I couldn't stop screaming. ... It was every scream I never screamed.\"\n\nThey were assaulted by men or boys they didn't know, and ones they were fixed up with, knew since childhood or were dating. One woman's attacker was a longtime crush; a second's a best friend. A third woman's attacker was a graduate student she looked up to as an undergrad; he was the \"golden boy\" in the academic department who could make or break her professional future. A fourth's supervised summer legislative interns on Capitol Hill.\n\nA fifth woman revealed she was assaulted by three men -- relatives or people connected to family members.\n\n\"Until their parents die, until they move away and I never have to see their face again, until I die -- most will never know that these people who walk among us have this fundamentally broken way of treating women,\" she wrote in a social media post.\n\nTo come forward about these men before then wouldn't be \"worth the headache,\" she said. But, \"if any of these people got anywhere near one of the highest offices in the land, I'd air their dirty laundry. ... Bless this woman (referring to Christine Blasey Ford) as she walks through this fire. I'm frankly relieved that I likely won't ever be in her shoes.\"\n\n'Bookend to Brock Turner'\n\nFor some, this moment has been triggering. One woman called it a \"bookend to Brock Turner,\" a story that hit a number of the women I heard from harder than this. Turner is the former Stanford University student who, in January 2015, was caught on campus, outside a fraternity, sexually assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster. He was sentenced to six months in jail but only served three.\n\nOne woman said the election of President Donald Trump was what did her in. She couldn't stop crying and was inconsolable the day after he won.\n\n\"I felt like my country had just said that a man who was known to be a serial sexual assaulter was worthy to hold the highest office, which meant that it was okay to assault women,\" she wrote.\n\nThe growing activism of women give many of them hope, even if they fear that what they want to see will take time.\n\n\"The ground beneath these men has shifted in ways that they are still not prepared for,\" one woman said.\n\nThey want to think, though, that high schoolers and college students are more sensitive and aware, better equipped to call sexual assault what it is and more inclined to speak up. They're afraid they may not be right.\n\nIf they could talk to their younger selves, they'd take them by the shoulders and tell them they didn't deserve the wrongs pushed on them.\n\nTheir own parents didn't talk to them in ways they talk to their own children. Their little ones, sons and daughters, learn about consent early and aren't required to hug or touch anyone they don't want to hug or touch. They're given lessons in boundaries and understand they have agency over their own bodies.\n\nSome have told their older kids what happened to them, while others say the details are something they'll never share. They don't shy away from using words such as rape and assault. They talk openly about relationships and how to honor partners. They insist their sons treat girls and women -- really, everyone -- with respect and tell their daughters to be vigilant.\n\nOne woman is waiting for the day when her kids will let her sign them up for self-defense classes.\n\n'A skeleton' in his closet\n\nThey question if they'd come forward like Kavanaugh's accusers.\n\nThere are those who can't fathom putting their own lives under the microscope or exposing their families to the fallout. Some look back and, even after all these years, worry that they were partially to blame. One said she'd want to dig into her attacker's more recent past, see if he's shown respect for women and allow for the chance that he'd changed. Others want to believe that if the greater good depended on it, they'd be as brave.\n\n\"The more 'the public' sees that this happened to countless women who did not report it, the harder it will be to deny the accusations of those who do come forward,\" one woman wrote in an email. \"We can't all be liars.\"\n\nA few women mentioned that they've Googled the men who assaulted them.

The local mall plastered \"Merry Christmas\" on its digital signs. And hundreds of people, in 90-degree weather, wore Santa hats as they caroled in front of one little boy's home. It's only September, but for a 2-year-old with terminal brain cancer, Christmas came early this year.\n\nColerain Township, a suburb of Cincinnati, celebrated the holiday this weekend because doctors say the boy, Brody Allen, wouldn't make it to December.\n\nDespite aggressive and painful chemotherapy, brain scans showed that Brody's five embryonal tumors were not responding to treatment. \"The doctor had tears in his eyes as he was telling us,\" said his aunt, Dina Brock. \"The poor boy had gone through so much in the hospital, but there wasn't any good news.\"\n\nAfter Brody spent more than 90 days at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, much of it in the intensive care unit, the Allen family decided to bring him home. Painful radiation therapy would do little for his prognosis, doctors told the family, and \"we wanted to do everything we could to let him live life,\" said Brock.\n\nBrody Allen, who has a rare form of brain cancer, celebrated Christmas early because he is not expected to live through December.\n\n\"He can't use the left side of his body, his speech has changed, and he has tremors,\" she said.

Hoping to celebrate the holidays one last time with their son, the family made a post asking friends and family for Christmas lights. That small request went viral, and more than 13,000 people have since joined the group, sending prayers from as far away as London and Paris. \"The love and attention they're giving Brody is unbelievable,\" said Brock. \"People are reaching out for no other reason than their good will.\" Love, not pity, was 5-year-old Julianna's lesson Back at home, Brody's neighborhood soon turned into a winter wonderland. Inflatable snowmen lined the streets and garland hung from fences and front doors. Brody was the Grand Marshal of his own superhero-themed Christmas parade, which featured Santa riding a firetruck, cheerleaders and a dazzling fireworks display this past Sunday. \"When the parade started, my family was in the front row to see it all,\" said Amanda Hill, a Colerain Township resident who watched with her husband and twin children. \"It was overwhelming and abundantly clear how much that little boy meant to the community.\" A town comes together In divisive times, Brody's story has brought family, friends and even strangers together. \"This is a community of people with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities and genders coming together for Brody,\" said Matt Castleman, a pastor at the Crossroads West Side church outside of Cincinnati. Castleman, who studied musical theater, worked with local radio station WARM 98.5 to organize a flash mob on Saturday outside of Brody's home. The Children's Theatre of Cincinnati provided reindeer and elf costumes, Castleman's church helped turn out singers, and the station took photos. Volunteers handed out lyric sheets at a local grocery store before consolidating cars and heading to Brody's neighborhood, where they distributed gifts and sang songs like \"Silent Night\" while holding hands. Santa to dying boy: Tell heaven you're my No. 1 elf \"The Allen family knew that we were coming, but they were shocked when we showed up with hundreds of people,\" Castleman said. It was so hot, he added, that \"you couldn't tell if people were crying or sweating.\" The airwaves were blanketed with the holiday spirit, too. \"We decided to play one Christmas song per hour with a shout out to Brody before every song, to help him celebrate with his family a little early,\" said Brian Demay, the program director at WARM 98.5. 'He definitely seems happier' That support has meant the world to Brody, an outgoing boy who spent months in the ICU, where he often wasn't allowed to see his brothers or sisters. \"He definitely seems happier to me,\" said Brock. \"He loves people and he's not afraid of anyone.\" \"He's a flirt,\" she added. \"He's a major flirt.

Brittany called him some choice names, and Ryan shrugged his shoulders and walked off.\n\nDespite that inauspicious beginning, and the many years of drug abuse that preceded it, the Colemans want to get out this message: There is life and love after drug addiction.\n\nThey want to give hope to those whose lives have been ravaged by the opioid epidemic , which kills more than 115 people every day in the United States.\n\n\"You just have to find the right people to get connected to to kind of show you the way out,\" said Brittany, 29.\n\nAddiction, rehab and relapse\n\nWhen Brittany Hokrein was 11 years old, her parents divorced, and she and her brothers and mother moved from Georgia to Pennsylvania.\n\nShe struggled emotionally, and at age 14 she started to use marijuana and alcohol so she wouldn't feel the hurt. Soon, pain pills became her drug of choice, and by age 18 she was addicted.\n\nRyan, now 37, was born into a military family, moving from Georgia to Germany to Texas and then back to Georgia. Like Brittany, he had a loving family, but as a teenager, he felt like he didn't fit in, and he started to smoke pot at age 14.\n\n\"I found that I could medicate that feeling. Life was great once I got high,\" he said.\n\nBy the time Ryan was 17, he was smoking pot every day, and he dropped out of high school senior year. He moved on to LSD and cocaine. By the time he was 20 he was hooked on painkillers.\n\nHis father, an Army drill sergeant, and his mother, a high school teacher, begged him to go to recovery. They told him a recovery program had saved his mother from alcoholism when Ryan was a child. But he rebelled and rejected everything his parents stood for.\n\nBy 22, he was strung out on heroin. \"I had to have it,\" he said.\n\nOver the next 10 years, Brittany and Ryan unknowingly led parallel lives. Hopping from city to city, they both used heroin, methamphetamines, prescription opioids, Xanax, cocaine and alcohol.\n\nBrittany overdosed three times, and Ryan overdosed five times. Ryan got arrested 16 times, mostly for stealing so he could get money to buy drugs. Brittany stole, too, and had a stint at prostitution.\n\nTheir parents loved them and helped get them into rehab programs. Each stint ended in a relapse.\n\nBy 2016, both Ryan and Brittany had moved back to Augusta, Georgia.\n\nThey happened to end up at the same recovery group meeting. Eight months had passed since they'd met at that drug deal in the parking lot.\n\nA forbidden love (and with good reason)\n\nHe's cute, Brittany thought when she met him again at rehab.\n\nShe's beautiful, Ryan thought. Really beautiful. And she looked so familiar.\n\nHe realized she was the woman he'd cheated in the drug deal.\n\n\"I thought, 'This was fate.' I walked right up to her and told her I needed to apologize for ripping her off,\" Ryan remembered. \"I did want to make amends, but I also had an ulterior moment. I wanted to date her.\"\n\nDating was discouraged in their recovery program -- and Brittany and Ryan found out why.\n\nAs they fell in love, they spent all their time together and their lives became intertwined. At first they both stayed sober but then slowly, imperceptibly, Ryan slipped away, taking Brittany with him.\n\nAfter about four months of dating, one Friday morning Ryan told Brittany he was going down to a park by the Savannah River to think about his life.\n\nBut instead, he drove two hours to Atlanta to buy heroin and cocaine.\n\nHe called her on the way and told her the truth. Brittany stood there with her phone in her hand. She wrote out a text that she knew she shouldn't send.\n\nIt said that Ryan needed to bring back some drugs for her. She stared at the text for a while. Then she hit send.\n\nAnd everything fell apart.\n\nGiving up heroin -- and each other\n\nFor the next week, Brittany and Ryan went right back to heroin, right back to cocaine, right back to meth, sometimes all at the same time.\n\n\"I even romanticized it, saying f*** all the rules, we're going to be heroin junkies together, all that 'Trainspotting' bull****,\" he said, referring to the 1996 film about young Britons on heroin. \"Addicts have a sick way of romanticizing their drug use.\"\n\nThen on October 3, 2016, they both overdosed on meth and heroin. Medics found Brittany lying on the floor of a gas station bathroom, and Ryan right outside, unconscious in his car.\n\nThe medics gave them doses of Narcan, the drug that reverses overdoses. Brittany had done so much heroin she needed two doses.\n\nRyan was wracked with guilt. He felt personally responsible for Brittany's near death in that gas station bathroom. He was the one who'd driven to Atlanta to get drugs when they were both working so hard to be clean. He was the one who said 'yes' when she asked him to bring some back for her.\n\n\"I had almost killed the person I loved the most,\" he said.\n\nBrittany returned to Hope House, a treatment center for women in Augusta.\n\nRyan visited here there. Surrounded by his sponsor from his recovery group and Brittany's counselors, he got down on his knees -- and apologized.\n\n\"He held my hand and apologized to me in front of all those people,\" Brittany said, crying at the memory of it. \"He was shaking and I was shaking. He said how sorry he was for putting me through all this and how scared he was to almost lose me.\"\n\nThey then had to do something they describe as just as hard as giving up heroin: They had to give each other up. For a month, they had no contact at all.\n\n\"The only way for us to survive was to focus only on our recovery, and not on each other,\" Brittany said. \"It was the only way it would work.\"\n\nBrittany then left Hope House, and the two met up at their recovery group's Thanksgiving dinner. They started back dating slowly, and then a year and a half later, on February 24, 2018, they were married.\n\nBrittany and Ryan Coleman on their wedding day in February.\n\nTwo years sober\n\nNext month marks two years of sobriety for both Brittany and Ryan, and today they live in a small house with four cats in Augusta. Ryan works at a vape store, where he's advanced from part-time clerk to assistant manager to manager. Brittany works at a rehab center, helping others overcome their addictions.\n\nThey volunteer to help others in recovery and have also spoken at programs that train people how to use Narcan, the drug that saved both of them so many times.\n\nWhen asked how they survived addiction where so many have died, they say it was the grace of God and to a large degree luck -- luck that those Narcan doses were available right when they needed them.\n\nThey also say they let other people guide them: their families, who never gave up on them; the rehab counselors who stuck with them; and their recovery mentors who showed them the way, including that they needed to focus on their individual recoveries and not on each other in order to survive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAll of those people joined them on their wedding day.\n\n\"It was really a culmination of all the good things going on in our lives finally really coming together,\" Ryan said.\n\nSometimes Brittany can't believe she's alive, much less in a loving, stable relationship.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. I don't think that I would have ever imagined that I would be married and happy and just planning a future with another human,\" she said. \"I didn't ever picture that for myself.\"\n\nThey want people in the throes of addiction to see that despite the dire statistics, there can be hope.\n\n\"I want them to see people like us and realize that we were in that same place at one point in our lives -- and we got out,\" Ryan said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/13/health/opioid-recovery-love-story/index.html", "published": "2018-09-13T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Claire Wineland, inspirational speaker and social media star, dies one week after lung transplant", "text": "No matter the obstacles placed in front of her, of which there were many, she refused to be pitied and was determined to live a life that mattered. She inspired countless people, invited -- no, demanded -- honest talk about illness and mortality, and brightened the worlds of those she touched with her smile, spunk and spirit.\n\nOn Sunday evening, after being taken off life support and using the newly transplanted lungs she received just one week earlier, Claire took her last breath. The cause of death was a massive stroke she suffered soon after the transplant surgery. She was 21.\n\n'Love what is'\n\nA quarter of Claire's life was spent in the hospital. The medical team that tended to her became family. She played hide-and-seek with nurses and left explosions of glitter in her wake. She watched one of her doctors squirm as he gave her the safe-sex talk. She took great care to decorate her hospital room so it felt and looked like home.\n\nHer parents, Melissa Nordquist Yeager and John Wineland, split up when Claire was 3, but they remained friends and partners in her care.\n\nHer father credits Claire with teaching him \"to not be afraid of what hasn't happened yet\" and to learn to \"love what is.\"\n\nYeager, who lost and quit jobs as hospital stays dictated, always marveled at her daughter's aura and her ability to lift up those around her.\n\nIn 2017, Yeager recalled a conversation with Claire about death. At one point, Claire looked at her mom and said, \"After you die, you're closer to everyone you love because you're part of everything,\" Yeager remembered.\n\nThese words were a gift, a reminder that Claire would remain with her always, even after she was gone.\n\nTrusting Claire\n\nMore than 30,000 people in the United States, more than 70,000 worldwide, have cystic fibrosis, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The median survival age is 40, the foundation reports, which is a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.\n\nClaire Wineland spent a quarter of her life in the hospital.\n\nThe genetic and progressive disease creates an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs. It also complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.\n\nThere is no cure, but dutiful breathing treatments -- which eat up hours each day -- can help with symptoms and complications. A double-lung transplant, when successful, can add years to a patient's life.\n\nClaire's parents learned to trust their independent and strong-willed daughter. When it came to her care, she knew her body best -- what worked for her, what didn't and how far she was willing to go.\n\nSo when she became a legal adult and told them she had no intention of getting a double-lung transplant, they had to accept her decision, even if it pained them.\n\n\"I had to be honest,\" she once explained. \"It's not for me and never has been.\"\n\nA change of heart\n\nClaire took the gift of life and her health seriously, but she didn't take herself too seriously. She once escaped from the hospital so she could attend a Bernie Sanders rally. She laughed at the absurdities that often swirled around her, including those moments in the produce aisle at Whole Foods when shoppers would prescribe her unsolicited \"cures,\" telling her to eat more pineapple or that a mushroom cleanse would take care of everything.\n\nClaire Wineland's greatest wish, her mother said, was that \"her foundation will live on, even in her absence.\"\n\nShe was of the mind that she would leave this world with the body she came in with. She'd travel, answer calls for speaking engagements and put energy into her foundation , which she set up at age 13 after coming out of a 16-day medically induced coma. She'd work on a book -- promising it wouldn't be \"another happy sick person book\" -- and appreciate the small things like swims in the ocean for as long as she was able.\n\nAt a TEDx talk she gave last year, Claire made a point of saying how cystic fibrosis helped give her a quality of life.\n\n\"Life isn't just about being happy. ... It's not about how you feel second to second,\" she said. \"It's about what you're making of your life and whether you can find a deep pride in who you are and what you've given.\"\n\nClaire had a change of heart about transplant earlier this year, prompted by a steep decline in her health that robbed her of the energy and ability to do what gave her joy and purpose. She wasn't done contributing. It was a welcome, albeit terrifying, development for those who loved her.\n\nTo get on the list for new lungs, she had to be sick enough to need them, yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery. Some people worried that she'd waited too long and wouldn't be given the chance at continued life.\n\nBut Claire took on the evaluation process to get on the list with laser focus. She sat in an educational meeting at UC San Diego Health's transplant center and diligently took notes.\n\nRevealed on her left ankle was a tattoo: the thumbs-up \"Don't Panic\" logo from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\"\n\nShe listened to the risks and the long list of side effects and emerged unfazed.\n\n\"None of it spooked me,\" Claire said afterward. \"Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do ... I'm willing to deal with anything.\"\n\n'It's a GO!!!'\n\nIn late May, she made the list and shared the exciting news with her social media followers who dot the globe. But then, a mix of health and life complications took a toll and knocked her off the list, temporarily. By mid-August, she was back on and feeling ready.\n\nClaire and her mother beamed in a photo posted on social media after they learned her transplant was a go.\n\nShe'd worked hard to get there, was focused on her self-care and getting stronger. She joked that the squats she was doing, upon doctor's orders, would help get her more than lungs. She'd also get a butt.\n\nShe knew that the call could come at any minute, and on August 26, it did.\n\n\"It's a GO!!!\" she posted on Twitter, not long before she was wheeled into the operating room in San Diego. \"See y'all on [the] other side.\"\n\nThe nine-hour surgery went well, and her mother reported that the lungs were working great. Yeager posted a video of herself doing a happy dance with friends in the waiting room.\n\nBut not long after the successful surgery, hope turned to fear. Claire suffered a stroke when a blood clot cut off blood flow to the right side of her brain. She never emerged from her medically induced coma. Despite emergency surgeries, and what her mother described as \"Herculean efforts\" to try to save her, the daughter she knew was gone. Given the severity of the stroke and Claire's advance directive, it became clear that it was time to let her go. She passed away peacefully, with her parents by her side.\n\n\"They saw her into this world for her first breath and were with her for her last,\" Laura McHolm, the board chair for Claire's foundation, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nLess than 3% of lung transplant recipients have a stroke between the surgery and hospital discharge, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which operates the nation's organ transplant system.\n\nClaire, who understood the importance of organ donation, was a donor herself. On Monday afternoon, her mother received word that Claire had already made a difference.\n\n\"Claire was able to save the life of two people, her right kidney was transplanted to a 44 year old woman in San Diego, and her left kidney was transplanted to a 55 year old male in Northern California. Also, Claire's corneas and tissue was recovered and she will be able to enhance the life of up to 50 people,\" a family services specialist wrote to Yeager in an email message. \"Claire's gift is huge, I want your family to know that your daughter is a hero.\"\n\nThe family intends to honor her memory by continuing to advance Claire's Place Foundation , which she established to financially support others affected by her lifelong disease.\n\n'Go enjoy it'\n\nIn one of the last videos Claire posted, she went where she hadn't before.\n\nA self-described \"goofball,\" she usually engaged people with humor and optimism. This time, she was raw and allowed herself to cry. As she faced the prospect of getting a double-lung transplant, she understood how desperate she was to live -- and give -- more.\n\n\"It hurts everything inside of me to make this video,\" she said into the camera. \"I didn't realize how much I didn't expect to live this long. I didn't expect to have a chance. ...

What if they poured everything into her transplant, and she didn't make it or was not able to work again, she explained later. She needed financial help. By asking for it, she said, she could relax and get in the headspace for whatever would come next.\n\nBefore signing off, Claire implored viewers to do one thing.\n\n\"Go enjoy your life. Really. I mean that seriously,\" she said with her signature smile and laugh, her eyes not yet dry. \"Go enjoy it, 'cause there are people fighting like hell for it.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/03/health/claire-wineland-obit/index.html", "published": "2018-09-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Slow down and live long with the ancient practice of qigong", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Among the skyscrapers of Hong Kong, eight senior citizens gather at the Happy Valley Recreation grounds in the Wan Chai district. It's time for their weekly class in qigong, an ancient Chinese mind-body practice similar to tai chi.\n\nIt's summer on the island, and at 8:30 in the morning, the temperature is already 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with an unforgiving level of humidity.\n\nBut the hot weather does not deter qigong Master Joe Lok's students; they believe wholeheartedly in the positive effects the practice has on their health.\n\nThe word qigong is a combination of \"qi,\" meaning energy, and \"gong,\" which loosely translates as an accomplishment or practice, explained Lok, who has been practicing qigong for nearly 30 years.\n\nIt is the accomplishment or practice of energy and involves becoming aware of your breathing, sensing the energy within you and then following a series of slow, coordinated movements.\n\nMovement, meditation and controlled breathing are the staples of every qigong session, with the ultimate focus being holistic well-being.\n\nLok explains that \"in order to do qigong ... we have to be pretend to be empty, so the first thing to empty is the mind, so we try not to think of anything and only listen to our breathing, relax all the strength and relax the mind, so it's some kind of meditation.\"\n\nMeditation has been shown to improve stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experts believe it goes hand-in-hand with healthy habits that can improve our longevity.\n\nAs a result, qigong itself is a health practice, Lok said.\n\nFeeling the energy\n\nFor Lok, it is vital that all his students experience \"qi\" before they begin any movements. He practices Taoist qigong, which has a strong connection with nature, he explained. In his class, he says that you can start to experience the \"qi\" by simply holding a specific posture.\n\nYour feet should be between hip and shoulder distance apart and your toes turned out slightly. From here, Lok encourages you to breathe deeply and straighten the curve in your lower spine by moving your hips slightly forward. With your hands hanging loosely, relax your body so you don't feel any pressure or tension on your joints.\n\nLok directs his students to focus and straighten their fingertips slightly with their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing at an angle down to the ground.\n\nStudents find 'Qi' by placing their hands in front of their stomachs and pointing them at an angle down to the ground.\n\nHe then asks his students whether they can sense \"qi\"-- a warm feeling or feeling of life in their fingertips, often causing a tingling sensation. Once his students all feel the it, the movement routine can begin.\n\nHe warns that you can easily wave your hands around without really experiencing \"qi,\" and that would completely defeat the purpose of his practice.\n\nThe goal of the movement is to clear blockages, release pain and refresh the body and mind.\n\nSlow and steady\n\nThe movements in qigong are very slow. Students raise their arms over their heads, rotate their wrists, lower their arms and then make circular motions with their hands. Lok says that \"as soon as you get into it, the qi begins to flow.\"\n\nEmotions are also calmed, and people tend to live happier, Lok believes.\n\nOne student slowly works through the Qigong movements.\n\nIn a day and age when wellness is prioritized and dozens of wellness practices sprout daily, with elements of the ancient practice of qigong forming the basis for many of them and studies highlighting the benefits.\n\nRemoving the mystery\n\nCecilia Chan, chair of the Department of Social Work and Social Administration at the University of Hong Kong, has been studying the effects of qigong for years. Her aim is simple: to demystify the seemingly inexplicable benefits.\n\nThere are a lot of \"misconceptions about qigong,\" said Chan, whose team studies internal qigong, or exercise qigong -- a simple set of movements in which no energy is given to participants through a qigong master; instead, the participants use their own energy to do the movements, similar to other movement practices, like yoga.\n\nThey do not explore external qigong, in which many believe that a qigong master can give you healing energy through hand gestures.\n\nChan believes that qigong can be beneficial to health, especially for those with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nHer team conducted studies on women with chronic fatigue in 2012, concluding that qigong \"may improve chronic fatigue symptoms and mental functioning.\"\n\nThey conducted another study in 2017 to explore whether qigong can reduce depression among women with chronic fatigue. \"From our study, we found that a lot of people after practicing qigong ... become more positive,\" Chan said. \"They become less indulged in their suffering, and they leave the victim's role more readily.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe likens qigong to other mind-body practices like yoga and adds that it \"teaches a philosophy of letting go,\" helping those who practice it to embrace a \"philosophy of let it be ... and be happy with yourself.\"\n\nResearchers at Harvard University have also been exploring the heath aspects of qigong, with their research finding that its practice can help with motor function and depression for individuals with Parkinson's disease.\n\nLok, however, needs no convincing that qigong works on many levels. He witnesses the healing benefits all around him in class. \"There's evidence everywhere that it benefits life in general,\" he said. \"If you have a little time, try qigong. Perhaps you will see the miracle in the qigong, but if you don't try it, there's no chance. ... Find a teacher near you or otherwise go online and start doing something. It's very easy, and the benefit is ever so great.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/29/health/live-longer-qigong-health-benefits-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-08-29T00:00:00"}, {"title": "From 'screw you' Aetna to Sweet 16, teen celebrates her surgery -- and new life", "text": "Nyack, New York (CNN) Cara Pressman raises her hands in triumph.

Everyone rushes outside.\n\nIt's as if Mother Nature has joined the party: A rainbow stretches from the Hudson River high into the heavens.\n\nCara launches her head back and strikes an array of poses as people take photos.\n\n\"That's what's important in life -- miracles, right?\" her mother, Julie Pressman, says, pointing to the sky. \"I can finally exhale.\"\n\nHer father, Rob, says it's \"like a unicorn coming down.\"\n\n\"She's been so happy since the operation,\" he says. \"We're looking forward to a great year.\"\n\nIt's a moment the family thought might never come.\n\nAfter Cara speaks, Aetna changes policy\n\nCara's mother became a fierce champion for her youngest daughter, determined that Cara would get the surgery her doctors believed could stop her seizures.\n\nA motivational note rests on the family refrigerator. Cara has suffered from a seizure disorder most of her life.\n\nEach time they struck, her body would grow cold and shake. She'd zone out anywhere from 20 seconds to two minutes, typically still aware of what was going on around her. She had seizures on the soccer field, during softball games, on stage during plays, in the classroom. Most anywhere.\n\nHer doctors last year recommended Cara for laser ablation surgery, a minimally invasive procedure in which a thin laser is used to heat and destroy lesions in the brain where the seizures originate.\n\nIt's cutting-edge work, performed through an eighth-inch hole in the skull. Neurosurgeons believe it to be more precise and less invasive than traditional open brain surgery, in which a two-inch hole is cut in the skull or, in some cases, the entire skull cap is removed.\n\nYet the nation's third-largest insurance company overruled her treating physicians. In denying her coverage, Aetna said it considered laser ablation surgery \"experimental and investigational for the treatment of epilepsy because the effectiveness of this approach has not been established.\"\n\n\"Clinical studies have not proven that this procedures [sic] effective for treatment of the member's condition,\" Aetna said.\n\nWhen first approached for comment by CNN late last year, the insurance giant stood by its denial.\n\nCara underwent the laser ablation surgery on July 25. Three weeks later, she says she's adjusting well: \"It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.\"\n\nIn response, Cara had this message : \"Considering they're denying me getting surgery and stopping this thing that's wrong with my brain, I would probably just say, 'screw you.' \"\n\nFrom there, the story took off. The hashtags #ScrewAetna and #CaraPressman were shared across Twitter. Her grandmother made T-shirts for family members for Christmas that read \"I'm on Cara's team\" on the front; on the back, the message said #SYA (short for #ScrewYouAetna ).\n\nGirl has blunt message for Aetna after her brain surgery request was deniedhttps://t.co/QMmPf2i4t0 \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 11, 2017\n\nBehind the scenes, neurologists and neurosurgeons reached out to the family, offering support. But none was more powerful than Mark Solazzo, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwell Health , New York's largest health care provider.\n\nThe hospital executive was so moved by Cara's story he told the family: \"This is the last day you're going to fight Aetna on your own.\"\n\nSolazzo is passionate on this issue: Insurance denials for what Northwell deems medically necessary procedures have swelled the past two years, with the health provider saying it lost $150 million in justifiable reimbursements at a time when insurance companies have been setting record profits.\n\nThe Northwell executive set in motion a chain of events. He tapped Dr. Ashesh Dinesh Mehta, the director of Northwell's epilepsy surgery, to handle Cara's case and even offered the surgery for free if Aetna still refused to cover it.\n\n\"I was happy to do that,\" Mehta said.\n\nBefore her Sweet 16 party, Cara spent the day getting her hair and makeup done.\n\nCara underwent a series of tests this spring with her new team at Northwell. Mehta said her case was complex because the focal point of her seizures was fairly deep in her brain behind her temple. To perform an open brain surgery, he said, he would need to dissect a portion of her brain to get to the spot.\n\nAs a result, Mehta said, her team agreed with her previous doctors that laser ablation was the route to go.\n\n\"We did our due diligence, and we did determine that this would be the best way to treat her epilepsy,\" he told CNN.\n\nAlong the way, Aetna had a change of heart. In April, the insurer notified the family it would cover the surgery: \"Coverage for this service has been approved, subject to the requirements in this letter.\"\n\nThere was no explanation. No apology. Just an approval with full coverage.\n\nPressed by CNN for answers, Aetna said the approval came after her doctors made a new request for laser ablation surgery. \"Based on recently published clinical evidence, the procedure was approved.\"\n\nAetna went on to say it recently updated its policies for epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation. \"Related, in July 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently-published data,\" Aetna said. \"The new guidelines cover laser ablation surgery if certain criteria are met.\n\n\"As shared in December, we constantly evaluate new published and peer-reviewed studies as well as additional evidence when developing our clinical policies, and will continue to do so.\"\n\nCara's mother, Julie, wanted the party to be especially memorable: \"It's not just a birthday party. It's literally like a debut. She's coming out of this brain surgery and is so radically different.\"\n\nMehta gave all the credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice: \"She really advocated for herself, and it worked out for her. Whatever happened, it got her the appropriate treatment. I've got to hand it to her.\"\n\nNorthwell's Solazzo added, \"Cara has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her. Her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery.\"\n\n'Never been more excited'\n\nThe day of the surgery, July 25, was filled with nerves and excitement. Cara's parents and older sister, Lindsey, crowded her hospital room before the operation. They gabbed about trivial, everyday stuff, as families often do.\n\nBut make no mistake. The importance of the day weighed on everyone.\n\nCara told staff at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset she had \"never been more excited for anything in my life.\" Her first grand mal seizure, when she fell to the floor and shook, came at the age of 9, but she remembers having smaller aura seizures, when she would space out for brief spells, as far back as kindergarten. She can have five seizures in a day, sometimes as many as 30.\n\n\"It's been really, really difficult to live with,\" she said.\n\nCara keeps a box filled with various anti-seizure medications from over the years. About 1/3 of epilepsy patients live with uncontrollable seizures because no available treatment works for them, according to the Epilepsy Foundation.\n\nAs she was wheeled off to the operating room, Dad wrapped his arms around Lindsey and held her, reassuring her that Cara would be OK.\n\nCara had waited until summer to undergo the surgery. That way, she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started.\n\nLaser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients, and Cara's mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery, known as a temporal lobectomy.\n\n\"This really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this -- that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done,\" she says.\n\nIn the operating room, the hourlong procedure \"went quite well,\" Mehta said. \"Everything went as planned.\"\n\nThere are only about 40 to 50 centers around the nation, Mehta said, where laser ablation surgeries are performed, with the technique becoming more popular in recent years. Mehta said existing data show about a 50% seizure-free rate for those who undergo laser ablation, compared to about 70% who undergo traditional open brain surgeries.\n\nA comprehensive study is underway to better define its efficacy. But Mehta said he has had better success than the national average: \"My results are about as good as the open temporal lobectomy.\"\n\nThe laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents, he says, because open surgery can be so daunting. Laser surgery is less invasive, requires less time in the hospital and has a quicker recovery, Mehta said.\n\nCara poses for pictures outside the banquet hall at Nyack Beach State Park as friends snap photos. \"You look like a princess,\" one friend says.\n\nPatients can suffer short-term memory loss, especially forgetting names of people they meet. \"It's not usually something that is devastating, especially when you're younger,\" he says. \"Given that she's young, we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt.\"\n\nCara had one grand mal seizure in the days after the surgery, but she'd forgotten to take her anti-seizure medicine the day before. Mehta also says it's not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery.\n\nBased on her recovery three weeks after surgery, he believes Cara has a 60% to 80% chance of being seizure-free. The benchmark will be a year from now. \"The big question is whether she will have one or two seizures a year or whether she has no seizures,\" Mehta says. \"We want no seizures.\n\n\"I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\"\n\nA new, vibrant Cara\n\nAt her birthday party, the new Cara is on full display. She dances. She laughs. She commands the crowd.\n\nCara's father, Robert, requested a slow dance with his daughter shortly after she blew out the candles on her birthday cake. \"Since the operation,\" he says, \"she has exploded -- just the joy in her personality.\"\n\nHer sister marvels at her transformation. \"She is just flourishing,\" Lindsey says. \"I've never seen her so vibrant and so open with herself.\"\n\nCara says it's been \"weird\" ever since her surgery because \"I feel so much better.\" It's also a bit of an adjustment to think she could actually be seizure-free.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"It kind of feels like it's a little bit of a dream, but I also know it's real.\"\n\nOn stage, Cara honors 16 of the closest people in her life, and each helps light an individual candle. She begins with her father: \"One of the funniest people I know.\"\n\nThere's the uncle who is \"one of the biggest weirdos I know,\" the friend who \"always knows when to cheer me up\" and the one who \"always has a smile on her face that never seems to leave.\"\n\nShe saves the 16th candle for her mom. Cara praises her as a triathlete and marathon runner, and thanks her for planning the entire party.\n\n\"She was there for me every single time I was in the hospital -- literally the best,\" Cara says. \"Mom, please come up and light the final candle!\"\n\nCara says she hopes she can inspire other teens with seizure disorders to advocate for themselves. \"It's been really, really difficult,\" she says. \"I've had to go through so much.\"\n\nAs the Beatles' \"Here Comes the Sun\" echoes across the room, Mom rushes to hug her daughter. As the two embrace, George Harrison's voice sings:\n\nLittle darling, the smiles returning to the faces\n\nLittle darling, it seems like years since it's been here.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/23/health/cara-pressman-surgery-update-aetna/index.html", "published": "2018-08-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Escape from the Mayo Clinic: Teen accuses world-famous hospital of 'medical kidnapping'", "text": "This is the first part of the series,\"Escape from the Mayo Clinic.\" Read the second part here. Also, read how CNN reported this story.\n\nSherburn, Minnesota (CNN) In a jaw-dropping moment caught on video, an 18-year-old high school senior rushes to escape from the hospital that saved her life and then, she says, held her captive.\n\nAt the entrance to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic, the young woman's stepfather helps her out of a wheelchair and into the family car.\n\nStaff members come running toward him, yelling \"No! No!\" One of them grabs the young woman's arm.\n\n\"Get your hands off my daughter!\" her stepfather yells.\n\nThe car speeds away, the stepfather and the patient inside, her mother at the wheel.\n\nMayo security calls 911.\n\n\"We have had a patient abduction,\" the security officer tells police, according to a transcript of the call.\n\n'A cautionary tale'\n\nThe patient's name is Alyssa Gilderhus.\n\nShe and her family say she wasn't abducted from the Mayo Clinic in February 2017; rather, she escaped. They say the hospital was keeping her there against her will -- that Mayo \"medically kidnapped\" her.\n\nUnhappy with the care she was receiving at Mayo, they say, they repeatedly asked for her to be transferred to another hospital. They say Mayo refused.\n\nAccording to police, Mayo officials had a different plan for Alyssa: They had asked the county for assistance in \"gaining guardianship of Alyssa,\" who was an adult.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus before her ruptured aneurysm and two-month hospitilization at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Mayo Clinic said hospital officials would be willing to answer CNN's questions if Alyssa signed a privacy release form giving them permission to discuss her case publicly with CNN. The spokeswoman, Ginger Plumbo, supplied that form to CNN.\n\nAlyssa signed the form, but Plumbo declined to answer CNN's questions on the record. Instead, she provided a statement, which said in part, \"We will not address these questionable allegations or publicly share the facts of this complex situation, because we do not believe it's in the best interest of the patient and the family. ... Our internal review determined that the care team's actions were true to Mayo Clinic's primary value that the patient's needs come first. We acted in a manner that honored that value for this patient and that also took into account the safety and well-being of the team caring for the patient.\"\n\nThis story is based on interviews with Alyssa and members of her family, a family friend, law enforcement officials and a former member of a Mayo Clinic board, as well as documents including law enforcement records and Alyssa's medical records.\n\nBy everyone's account, this is an unfortunate and devastating story about a bitter clash that went out of control -- a clash between a Minnesota farm family and one of the world's most revered hospitals.\n\n\"It's confusing to me why this went off the rails so horribly,\" said Richard Saver, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who at CNN's request reviewed medical and legal documents that the family and law enforcement officials provided to CNN.\n\nArt Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the New York University School of Medicine, also reviewed the documents, and he agrees.\n\n\"This should never have happened,\" he said. \"This is a cautionary tale.\"\n\nA Christmas Day aneurysm\n\nThe relationship between Alyssa's family and the Mayo Clinic started off well.\n\nOn Christmas morning 2016, Alyssa settled in with a mug of hot chocolate to open her gifts. She was surrounded by her large family: her mother, Amber Engebretson, a stay-at-home mom; Duane Engebretson, her stepfather since she was 4 years old, who manages a construction company and the family's farms; and her five younger siblings, then 18 months to 11 years old.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus on Christmas morning 2016.\n\nThey live in Sherburn, Minnesota, population just over 1,000 people, about 150 miles southwest of Minneapolis, on a farm with sheep, cows, horses and pigs.\n\nAlyssa was thrilled with her first Christmas present: a pair of cowboy boots emblazoned with the emblem of the Future Farmers of America, her favorite club.\n\nThen she went to the bathroom. Her parents heard screaming.\n\n\"Mom, I need you!\" Alyssa yelled as she lay curled up on the floor, vomiting.\n\nIt was immediately obvious this was much more than just a stomach bug. Her left side was very weak, and she couldn't hear out of her left ear.\n\n\"You could see looking at her that she was petrified,\" her stepfather said.\n\nHe called an ambulance. A local hospital determined that Alyssa, who'd always been healthy, had a ruptured brain aneurysm : A blood vessel inside her brain had suddenly and unexpectedly burst.\n\nSurgeons explained that her life was on the line. They drilled a hole in her skull to relieve the pressure on her brain.\n\nA nurse gave her parents a bag of Alyssa's hair, which had been shaved off for the operation. Some people liked to have it, she said.\n\nAmber and Duane cried as they considered that this bag of hair -- their daughter's long, beautiful hair -- might be all they had left if she died.\n\nThey begged to have her sent to the Mayo Clinic. The main campus for the world-renowned medical center was 85 miles away in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n\"They're the best. People come from all over the world to go to Mayo,\" said Alyssa's mother, Amber Engebretson, who worked as a vehicle inspector for the Minnesota State Patrol before staying home to care for her family.\n\nBut Alyssa couldn't get to Mayo immediately. There was an ice storm. Ambulances couldn't drive, and helicopters couldn't fly.\n\nThe weather eventually broke, and about 7 p.m. -- about nine hours after the aneurysm -- Alyssa finally arrived by ambulance at Mayo headquarters in Rochester.\n\nOn Christmas night, surgeons gave her a 2% chance of living, her parents said. Doctors wrote in her medical record that her prognosis was \"grim.\"\n\nHer parents reached out on Facebook for prayers. They called their daughter the #Christmasmiraclegirl.\n\nAlyssa lived up to that name. She survived, thanks to four brain surgeries over the next month. Her doctors were ecstatic.\n\n\"They were like, she's not supposed to be here. She beat the odds,\" her stepfather said.\n\n\"Mayo neurosurgeons saved her life,\" added her mother. \"We'll be grateful to them forever.\"\n\nOn January 30, Alyssa was transferred from the neurology unit to the rehabilitation unit.\n\nIt should have been a happy turning point. But that's when the troubles began.\n\nTensions flare\n\nAlthough all had gone smoothly on the neurology floor, the family got into conflicts with the rehab staff almost immediately.\n\nFirst, doctors there wanted to take Alyssa off oxycodone, a powerful opioid painkiller that the neurology doctors had prescribed for pain after surgery. Her most recent surgery -- the fourth in one month -- had been just a few days before.\n\n\"She'd lay in bed with tears coming out of her eyes because she was in so much pain,\" her stepfather said.\n\nMany medical authorities, including the Mayo Clinic's website , say opioids are critical for post-surgical pain management.\n\nA week after Alyssa arrived on the rehabilitation floor, her mother shared her feelings on Facebook.\n\n\"[Alyssa's] and my frustration level was high and it seems that they just don't listen sometimes,\" Amber wrote on February 7.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her mother and stepfather, Amber and Duane Engebretson, and her younger siblings.\n\nMore disputes arose. Her parents say their daughter's breathing tube was the wrong size, and they had to pester doctors to get it corrected. They also say the family -- not doctors -- discovered that she had a bladder infection. They say a social worker discussed private financial information within earshot of visiting friends and relatives.\n\nHer parents asked for the social worker and a doctor to be replaced.\n\n\"We just need someone who will at least listen to us and hear us,\" Amber wrote on her Facebook page on February 20.\n\nAlyssa's parents say that at their request, they had a meeting with her care team on February 21.\n\n\"I had two whiteboards filled up with questions left unanswered, tests left undone, and every other question we could think of,\" Amber wrote on her Facebook page that day.\n\nAmber says that at one point during that meeting, she told the staff she felt like they \"don't give a f***,\" later apologizing for her language. She also asked for a second doctor to stop taking care of their daughter.\n\n\"We took no crap and laid it all on the line. ... Because seriously what do we have to lose at this point,\" Amber wrote on Facebook that night.\n\nMayo kicks Mom out\n\nOn February 22, the day after that meeting, Amber got into a disagreement with a nursing aide and asked to have her removed from her daughter's care team. She was the fourth staffer the family had asked to be replaced in just three weeks.\n\nThat afternoon, Amber says, she was scheduled to have a meeting with the social worker -- the same one she'd asked to leave her daughter's care.\n\nAmber had requested the meeting, and she says that as she approached the office at the appointed time, a man she'd never seen was standing in the office doorway. She said he saw her coming and went into the office and shut the door.\n\nAmber listened through the door. She says that as she suspected, the man and the social worker were talking about her family.\n\n\"I proceeded to open the door and say, 'Since you're talking about my family, I think it's only appropriate that I would be here also, to be included in the conversation,' \" she remembers.\n\nShe says the man puffed out his chest and stepped toward her, and she took a backward step into the hall. The man, who Amber later learned was a physician, demanded that she leave.\n\nShe says the man told her, \"I run this whole rehab unit. Do you understand me?\"\n\nAmber describes the doctor as \"intensely aggressive.\"\n\nShe replied to him, she says, with similar aggression and frustration: \"I need to talk to you. Do you understand me?\"\n\nThe doctor walked away.\n\nCNN reached out to this doctor and other staff members involved in Alyssa's care but did not receive responses.\n\nAbout an hour later, Alyssa's parents say, the same doctor, the social worker and a nurse approached the family. They were accompanied by three security guards.\n\n\"[The doctor] said to me, 'You are not allowed to participate in Alyssa's care. You are not allowed on Mayo property. You will be escorted off the premises right now,' \" Amber remembers.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her mother, Amber Engebretson.\n\nAmber and Duane say they asked why Amber was being kicked out but did not receive an answer.\n\nLater, a social worker would tell police that \"Amber interrupted a meeting because Amber was upset over the care Alyssa was receiving. Due to that incident, Amber was escorted off of [Mayo] property.\"\n\nAccording to Alyssa's parents, the doctor told Duane that he could stay but that he would not be allowed to have any involvement in his stepdaughter's care.\n\nThe couple say they asked the doctor whether they could speak with a patient advocate.\n\n\"He said, 'There is no patient advocate,' and walked away,\" Amber said.\n\nWhen asked about Amber's dismissal from the hospital, Mayo spokeswoman Plumbo sent CNN a statement.\n\n\"Our care teams act in the best interests of our patients. As a general practice, this includes sharing information with family members and facilitating family visits and interactions with patients and their care providers when the patient is in our care. However, in situations where care may be compromised or the safety and security of our staff are potentially at risk, the family members' ability to be present in the hospital may be restricted.\"\n\nPlumbo did not elaborate on whether or how Amber compromised her daughter's care or placed staff at risk.\n\n\"We would never compromise her care,\" Amber said. \"She's our daughter. We love her.\"\n\nShe also says she never put staff members at risk. \"We would never do that -- ever,\" she said.\n\nOn February 23, the day after Amber was kicked out, she went on Facebook.\n\n\"PRAYER WARRIORS UNITE!!!! We need your help. ... Please READ THIS AND SHARE THIS POST in hopes it reaches the people or person who can help us,\" she wrote.\n\n\"I HAVE BEEN TOLD I AM NOT ALLOWED IN ALYSSA'S ROOM AND NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY SAY OR PARTICIPATE IN HER [CARE]. ... I AM NOT ALLOWED TO SEE HER!! We have been given no reason why, no paperwork, and no explanations,\" she continued. \"I never imagined something like this could happen in our world and a very hard situation already has been made even harder!!\"\n\nThe response from one Facebook user led the family to conclude that they needed to get Alyssa out of Mayo, and fast.\n\n'Basically a prisoner at Mayo'\n\nAlyssa, who was legally an adult during her entire hospitalization, says that around this time, she started asking doctors and nurses to transfer her to another facility.\n\nShe says she never received a response.\n\n\"They were cruel to me,\" Alyssa said, adding that she wanted to get out of Mayo \"as bad as possible.\"\n\nOn February 23, three weeks into her daughter's stay in rehab, Amber complained on Facebook, tagging Mayo.\n\n\"They refuse to let her go. ... We cannot transfer [Alyssa] out or get her discharged,\" she wrote. \"No one has any say in [Alyssa's care] and she is basically a prisoner of Mayo.\"\n\nAlyssa's stepfather and grandmother say they also asked to have her transferred out of Mayo.\n\n\"I asked two to three times a day, and it would go nowhere,\" Duane said.\n\n\"Duane said, 'This is ridiculous. We don't want her here; Alyssa doesn't want to be here; she doesn't feel safe here,' \" her grandmother Aimee Olson remembers. \"But there was no response.\"\n\nDuane says he tried to talk to a senior doctor on the rehab staff about a transfer. It was the same doctor who had asked his wife to leave the hospital.\n\n\"He said 'I have nothing to say to you. This is a legal problem,' \" Duane remembers. \"I even asked him, 'can I speak to your supervisor, your boss,' and his exact words were 'I run this whole floor,' and [he] turned around and walked out of the room, and that was it.'\n\nDuane says he called the Mayo Patient Experience office and in a 45-minute phone call described the family's grievances. He said the patient experience specialist told him he would be back in touch after getting Mayo's side of the story.\n\nOlson, Alyssa's grandmother and Amber's mother, said she also tried to speak with the senior doctor but was told he wasn't available.\n\n\"She was truly being held captive,\" Olson said. \"I would never believe a hospital could do that -- never in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nThe family and a friend say they were instructed by Mayo staff not to talk to Alyssa about her mother.\n\nTwo nurses were assigned to be with Alyssa, and they kept careful watch, according to visitors.\n\n\"It was like they were watching every move you made,\" said Joy Schmitt, Alyssa's boyfriend's mother, who visited frequently after Amber was asked to leave the hospital.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her younger sister resting at the Mayo Clinic.\n\n'They were taking over our daughter'\n\nOn February 21, the day before her mother was kicked out of the hospital, a Mayo psychiatrist examined Alyssa and found that she lacked the capacity to make her own medical decisions, according to a summary of her care that her doctors wrote after she left Mayo.\n\nAround this time, a hospital social worker went to adult protection services in two counties to try to get those authorities to get guardianship over Alyssa, according to the police. If they had succeeded, she would have become a ward of the state.\n\nAlyssa and her family say that they weren't told any of this as it was happening but that around this time, they started to feel that Mayo was isolating Alyssa.\n\nOn February 26, staffers confiscated Alyssa's cell phone, laptop and tablet after finding that she'd made a video for her mother, according to Alyssa and her family. They say Alyssa's visitors were also banned from bringing their devices into the hospital.\n\nJUST WATCHED Alyssa Gilderhus' video for her mom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Alyssa Gilderhus' video for her mom 00:24\n\nThe same day, Mayo staffers said no one would be allowed to stay overnight with Alyssa, according to Duane and Amber's sister, April Chance, who attended a meeting with Alyssa's care team.\n\nDuane says he asked the staff to reconsider. He said his stepdaughter had never spent the night alone in the hospital. But he says they refused.\n\n\"The doctors said they were doing this for Alyssa's own benefit,\" Duane said.\n\nThe family says the doctors also told them that visitors would no longer be allowed to attend Alyssa's treatment sessions, such as physical and occupational therapy.\n\n\"I said, 'We're her cheerleaders. We cheer her on,' \" her aunt remembers. \"And they said 'No, you're impeding her care.' \"\n\nShe said the staff didn't elaborate on how they were impeding her care.\n\n\"They were restricting us little by little from even being with Alyssa. They were taking over our daughter,\" Duane said.\n\nMayo also pushed back Alyssa's discharge date, which was supposed to be February 27.\n\nMeanwhile, her mother's following was growing on Facebook, with many users posting angry messages that tagged Mayo.\n\nOne woman sent Amber links to stories about a teenager named Justina Pelletier.\n\nArticles in The Boston Globe and elsewhere described how in 2013, Pelletier, then 14 years old, was placed in state custody for nearly 16 months after Boston Children's Hospital accused her parents of interfering in her care. She spent much of that time in a psychiatric ward.\n\nAmber says she spoke on the phone with Justina's parents, Linda and Lou Pelletier. She says they warned her there would be signs that the hospital was seeking guardianship for their daughter. They would keep a tight watch over her and limit her communications with her family.\n\nThrough their lawyer, John T. Martin, the Pelletiers confirmed that they had conversations with Amber.\n\nA spokeswoman for Boston Children's Hospital told CNN that the hospital is \"committed to the best interest of our patients' health and well-being\" and declined to discuss the specifics of the case.\n\nAmber sent a text to the woman who'd sent her the news articles.\n\n\"OMG I am SICK. This is what is happening,\" Amber wrote. \"It rings lots and lots of bells. ... Omg ... I am so scared.\"\n\nA Mayo board member steps in\n\nAlyssa's parents reached out to a friend of a friend for help: Mark Gaalswyk, who at the time was a member of the board of directors for the Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont, Minnesota.\n\nGaalswyk emailed a Mayo Clinic vice president.

They were right: Hospital staffers would later tell police that they had gone to two county adult protection agencies to make guardianship arrangements.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her siblings at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nDuane and his wife, Amber Engebretson, weren't sure how to get their daughter out of Mayo. Two nurses had been assigned to watch over her at all times.\n\nBut on February 28, 2017, an idea struck Duane as he sat in Alyssa's hospital room.\n\nHe looked at one of the nurses. She had been with them a few weeks before, when Alyssa's great-grandmother had come for a visit.\n\nBetty Stalheim was 80. She'd just had knee surgery. She was fragile.\n\nIf he told the nurses that Grandma Betty wanted to visit but couldn't make it all the way upstairs to Alyssa's room, it might just sound believable, he figured.\n\nHe put his plan into action about 4 p.m., with his 9-year-old daughter, Allie, secretly videotaping with a small GoPro camera hidden in her hand. He told CNN he wanted the videotape to show that Alyssa had left the hospital willingly and that he hadn't been violent with staff, and to record actions taken by Mayo employees.\n\nDuane told the nurses he wanted to take Alyssa downstairs to say hello to Grandma Betty in the lobby.\n\nThe video shows Duane pushing Alyssa in her wheelchair down the hospital hallway. She has a bandage on her neck where her breathing tube had been removed a few days before.\n\nTwo women in scrubs follow them.\n\nWhen the group arrives in the lobby, there is no Grandma Betty.\n\nDuane says he sees Grandma Betty's car at the entrance and walks out the hospital doors with the two staff members trailing behind him.\n\nAs he approaches the car, the front passenger door opens.\n\nThere is no Grandma Betty. She was never there. Instead, Alyssa's mother is in the driver's seat.\n\n\"Alyssa, we're going to go home, honey. Come on,\" Amber says to her daughter.\n\nAs Duane helps his stepdaughter out of the wheelchair and into the passenger seat, the two women in scrubs run toward her, and someone yells, \"No!\"\n\n\"Yes, she is! Yes, she is!\" Duane and Amber yell back.\n\nThe video shows a hand grabbing Alyssa's arm as Duane helps her into the car. A nursing aide would later tell police she had tried to grab her.\n\n\"Get your hands off my daughter,\" Duane yells at the aide.\n\nDuane closes the car door and gets in the back seat.\n\n\"Get out of here, Amber,\" he tells his wife. \"Go, go, go, go, go, go!\"\n\nThe car drives away from Mayo.\n\nRecalling her escape some months later, Alyssa says it felt \"phenomenal.\"\n\n\"It was like the biggest weight off my shoulders,\" she said.\n\n'We have a patient abduction'\n\nAt 4:28 p.m., a Rochester Police dispatcher received a call from Mayo Clinic security.\n\n\"We have a patient abduction,\" the caller said.\n\nAn officer arrived on the scene 20 minutes later.\n\nA Mayo social worker told him that Alyssa \"cannot make decisions for herself\" and that her mother couldn't care for her \"because Amber has mental health issues.\"\n\nThe social worker also told police she \"understood there was no formal diagnosis\" for Amber.\n\nAmber told CNN she has no history of mental illness and took offense to the social worker making such an unqualified pronouncement.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus as a child with her grandmother Betty Stalheim, mother, Amber Engebretson, and younger siblings.\n\n\"It's absolutely absurd,\" Amber said. \"She said it to the police department. She has no reasoning. She has no justification.\"\n\nThe social worker told the police she'd been working with adult protection services in two Minnesota counties \"trying to get emergency guardianship\" but had been unable to get court orders to do so.\n\nAn Olmsted County Adult Protective Services official told police that \"Mayo was requesting [assistance] in gaining guardianship of Alyssa because they were concerned for the mother's mental health and the medical decisions that were being made for Alyssa.\"\n\nBut something didn't quite make sense to John Sherwin, captain of investigations for the Rochester Police Department.\n\nIf Alyssa couldn't make decisions for herself, as the social worker had said, and if she needed a legal guardian appointed for her, then who had been making decisions for her while she was in the hospital?\n\nWhen police asked that question of Mayo staffers, Sherwin said, they replied that Alyssa had been making her own medical decisions.\n\n\"When doctors were consulting with her in regards to her medical care, they weren't doing so through a guardian or someone that had been appointed by the courts. It was in direct contact with the patient,\" Sherwin said.\n\nHe said it became clear to investigators that Alyssa \"in fact could make decisions on her own\" -- including the decision to leave the hospital against medical advice.\n\n\"There was no abduction. This was done under her own will,\" he said. \"You had a patient that left the hospital under their own planning.\"\n\nThough satisfied that Alyssa was capable of making her own decisions, Sherwin still was concerned about her health.\n\n\"What was relayed to us [by Mayo staff] was that the patient was in danger of dying if they were not in the hospital,\" Sherwin said.\n\nMayo sent the police an order for a 72-hour hold, which allows police to admit someone to a hospital emergency room against their will if they're a danger to themselves.\n\nBut first, the police had to find Alyssa.\n\nPolice search for Alyssa\n\nAlyssa and her parents were on the run. They weren't answering their cell phones, and they weren't at home, either.\n\nThey later told CNN they figured the police would bring Alyssa to a hospital, and given the large number of Mayo facilities in Minnesota, there was a good chance that hospital would be a Mayo hospital.\n\n\"We felt that if [Mayo] got their hands on her, they would latch on and we wouldn't get her back again,\" Duane said.\n\nAlyssa moments after she escaped from the Mayo Clinic with the help of her parents.\n\nUnable to find the family, the police pinged their cell phones. This pointed them to an Applebee's restaurant in Mankato, Minnesota, about 85 miles west of Rochester. Officers searched the restaurant and a nearby Five Guys but couldn't find Alyssa, according to a Mankato police report.\n\nIt turned out the ping was a bit off: The family was down the street at Walmart, purchasing a wheelchair, a walker and a syringe for Alyssa's feeding tube, which Duane says he'd been trained to use. They then checked into a nearby hotel.\n\nWhile at the hotel, the family received a phone call from a Martin County sheriff's deputy. They say they told the deputy that their daughter was doing well, and they planned to bring her to a doctor the next day to get her checked.\n\nThe deputy said that wasn't good enough. He told them they were on their way to them, according to the family.\n\nAlyssa and her parents scrambled and left the hotel.\n\nIt was now almost 9 p.m., and nearly five hours had passed since they'd left Mayo. The family was on the road with three police agencies -- Rochester, Mankato and Martin County -- on their heels.\n\nAs Alyssa's stepfather drove down the highway, a sheriff's deputy called, urging them to bring their daughter to a hospital right away. They told him they'd bring her to a hospital in Jackson, about 75 miles away.\n\nBut then, the family reconsidered. They'd chosen Jackson because it had a hospital that wasn't owned by Mayo. But they feared that the doctors there might transfer her to a Mayo facility.\n\nAfter the calls from police, Alyssa's parents figured out that their phones were being pinged and took the batteries out.\n\nThey got off the highway and drove on gravel roads without a map.\n\n\"I just kept heading west. I knew I would run into South Dakota sooner or later,\" he said.\n\n'This kid is in danger'\n\nThe next afternoon, March 1, one of Alyssa's doctors, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Mayo, spoke on the phone with Sherry Bush-Seim, a Rochester police investigator.\n\nThe doctor warned that Alyssa was in grave danger.\n\n\"The longer she's away, the higher likelihood that she's gonna get very, very sick,\" the physician said, according to a transcript of the conversation that police provided to CNN.\n\nThe day Alyssa left Mayo, that doctor and a colleague had written a discharge note.\n\n\"Alyssa's medical condition, medical status, cognition, and physical impairments require an ongoing inpatient level of medical care,\" the doctors wrote. \"She was not medically or functionally safe to leave the hospital at the time of her removal from the hospital by her stepfather.\"\n\nAlyssa was at risk for pneumonia, malnourishment, dehydration, aspiration, infection and falling, according to the note. She didn't have her medications with her, and her parents weren't trained on how to use her feeding tube, according to the discharge summary.\n\nThe doctor said Alyssa was probably \"a ways from here by now\" and requested a wider-scale search.\n\n\"[It's] incredibly frustrating that something isn't out nationally given that [this] family may be hopping from doctor to doctor,\" the doctor said.\n\n\"We wouldn't do that nationally,\" Bush-Seim responded. \"That wouldn't be done.\"\n\nWithout a national search, the doctor said, \"we're not gonna find her.\"\n\nBush-Seim assured the physician that the Rochester police had \"done everything they possibly could to find her.\"\n\n\"There's got to be something more. This kid is in danger,\" Alyssa's doctor responded.\n\nThe police back off\n\nBut other doctors disagreed with the Mayo physician.\n\nLess than 12 hours after leaving Mayo, she and her parents arrived at the emergency room for Sanford Medical Center in Sioux Falls, a teaching hospital for the University of South Dakota.\n\nThey explained to Sanford doctors that she'd had an aneurysm and left Mayo against medical advice, according to medical records from that emergency room visit.\n\nThe Sanford doctors disagreed with the Mayo doctors on two crucial points.\n\nAlthough Mayo doctors had insisted that Alyssa needed to be in the hospital, the Sanford doctors came to the opposite conclusion: They prescribed Alyssa medications, gave instructions for her to follow up with a doctor and told her she could go home.\n\nMayo had determined that Alyssa lacked the mental capacity to make her own decisions. The Sanford doctors again came to the opposite conclusion: They allowed her to make her own decisions and sign her own forms consenting to treatment.\n\nWhen police learned that a hospital had cleared Alyssa to go home, they stepped aside.\n\n\"If a doctor at another facility says she's fine and comes up with a second opinion, that kind of takes the law out of it,\" said Chris Vasvick, a Martin County sheriff's deputy. \"That's one doctor's opinion against another, and that doesn't have anything to do with law enforcement at all.\"\n\nSherwin, the Rochester detective, agreed.\n\n\"We didn't have any reason for the police to intervene,\" Sherwin said.\n\nHe added that Alyssa and her parents had done nothing illegal. No charges were filed against them.\n\n\"As parents, they were probably thinking that they were acting on her best interest. I think the same could be said for the doctors and staff at Mayo Clinic. I think that they also felt they were acting on her best interest,\" Sherwin said.\n\nA few days after her visit to the Sanford emergency room, Alyssa and her parents went home.\n\nA letter from Mayo was waiting for them, thanking Duane for getting in touch with the patient experience office.\n\nThe family found it ironic, given that it was dated March 1, the day after Alyssa left the hospital.\n\nA few days later, another letter arrived from an administrator at Mayo, saying that it would not treat Alyssa or her parents.\n\n\"We have made this decision because of your actions which demonstrate a lack of trust and confidence in Mayo,\" the administrator wrote.\n\nOn Facebook, Amber shared that Alyssa's health was improving.\n\n\"This kid amazes me every day!! And we all could not be more proud!!\" she wrote.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus with her parents months after they helped her escape from the Mayo Clinic.\n\n'Hospitals aren't prisons'\n\nTo understand the legal and ethical issues in Alyssa's case, CNN showed experts key documents, including law enforcement reports; a transcript of portions of CNN's interview with Sherwin, the detective at the Rochester Police Department; and summaries of her care written by doctors at Mayo and Sanford.\n\nThe experts emphasized that those documents don't tell the whole story; only a thorough reading of her full medical records and interviews with Mayo staff would provide a complete picture.\n\n\"You're only hearing one side,\" cautioned Dr. Chris Feudtner, a professor of pediatrics, medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.\n\nAfter reviewing the documents, the experts wondered why Mayo did not allow Alyssa, who was 18 and legally an adult, to leave the hospital when she made clear that she wanted to be transferred, according to the family.\n\nThey said that typically, adult patients have the right to leave the hospital against medical advice, and they can leave without signing any paperwork.\n\n\"Hospitals aren't prisons. They can't hold you there against your will,\" said George Annas, an attorney and director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics & Human Rights at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\nBut Alyssa's doctors say she wasn't a typical patient.\n\n\"Due to the severity of her brain injury, she does not have the capacity to make medical decisions,\" her doctors wrote in her records after she'd left the hospital.\n\nIn that report, the doctors specified that assessments in the last week of her hospital stay showed that she lacked \"the capacity to decide to sign releases of information, make pain medication dose changes, and make disposition decisions. This includes signing paperwork agreeing to leave the hospital against medical advice.\"\n\nThat hadn't jibed with the captain of investigations for the Rochester police. Sherwin said it didn't make sense that Mayo staffers told police Alyssa had been making her own decisions, yet in the discharge note, they stated she wasn't capable of making her own decisions.\n\nIt didn't jibe with the experts, either.\n\n\"They can't eat their cake and have it, too,\" said Feudtner, the medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nEven if Alyssa truly did lack the capacity to make her own medical decisions, the experts had questions about Mayo's efforts to obtain emergency guardianship for Alyssa.\n\nBrian Smith, the Rochester police officer who responded to Mayo's 911 call the day Alyssa left Mayo, said a Mayo social worker told him she'd been working for a week or two to get a Minnesota county to take guardianship over Alyssa.\n\n\"The county would have guardianship over her and would make decisions for her,\" he told CNN.\n\nIf that happened, Alyssa most likely would have stayed at Mayo, as she was already receiving treatment there, Smith said.\n\nBush-Seim, the Rochester police investigator, spoke with an official at one of the county adult protection agencies. She said it was also her understanding that Mayo wanted the county to take guardianship of Alyssa, or that perhaps Mayo itself wanted to directly take guardianship of her.\n\nThe legal experts said they were not surprised that Mayo was unable to get court orders for such guardianship arrangements. It's a drastic and highly unusual step for a county or a hospital to take guardianship over a patient, they said, rather than have a family member become the patient's surrogate decision-maker.\n\nRobert McLeod, a Minneapolis attorney who helped the state legislature draft its guardianship laws, did not review the documents pertaining to Alyssa, as he did not want to comment on any specific case.\n\nHe said that before appointing a county or a hospital as a legal guardian, a judge would ask why a family member or close friend hadn't been selected as a surrogate.\n\n\"From my 25 years of experience, a judge is going to say, 'why isn't the family the first and best choice here?' and it had better be a good reason,\" said McLeod, an adjunct professor at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\n\nOther experts agreed.\n\nSaver, the professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said that in his four years working in the general counsel's office at the University of Chicago Hospitals and Health System, he doesn't once remember the hospital seeking guardianship for a patient who had a responsible relative or friend who could act as surrogates.\n\n\"It's thought of as kind of the atom bomb remedy,\" Saver said. \"I'm a little flummoxed what to make of this. They had family members on the scene to look to.\"\n\nAlyssa said her biological father, Jason Gilderhus, told her that Mayo asked him to become her guardian. He did not become her guardian and did not respond to CNN's attempts to reach him.\n\nEven if Mayo had concerns about Alyssa's mother and her biological father didn't work out, there were other friends and relatives to turn to, such as her stepfather, grandmother, great-grandmother, aunt or boyfriend's mother.\n\n\"It's so baffling why they didn't try to designate a surrogate before trying to get a guardian,\" added Dr. R. Gregory Cochran, a physician and lawyer and associate director of the Health Policy and Law program at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco.\n\nAnother feature of Alyssa's case also surprised the experts.\n\nCaplan, the NYU bioethicist, said that in complicated and contentious cases like this one, doctors typically reach out to their hospital's ethics committee for help.\n\nAn ethics committee would listen to the doctors, other staff members, the patient and the family to try to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe family says no one ever mentioned an ethics committee to them, and there's no mention of an ethics committee consult in the discharge summary in Alyssa's medical records.\n\nAnnas, the lawyer at Boston University, agreed that an ethics committee consultation would have been an obvious and important way to help resolve the dispute before it spun out of control.\n\n\"Disputes between families and hospital staff happen all the time, and they can either escalate or de-escalate,\" Annas said. \"An ethics consult can help sort out the issues so they de-escalate.\"\n\nThe experts said they were disappointed that in Alyssa's case, the conflict escalated.\n\n\"I was shocked to see that parents had to pull a fast one to get their daughter out of the hospital,\" said Cochran, of the University of California.\n\n\"I felt sad,\" said Feudtner, the ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Viewed in its entirety, this did not go well for anybody who was involved.\"\n\nGaalswyk, the former Mayo board member, said he hopes the hospital learns something.\n\n\"I hope that someone somewhere will look at what happened in this unfortunate case and improve both our Mayo employee's actions and patient systems so that it not need happen again to any other patient at Mayo,\" he wrote a Mayo vice president after Alyssa left the hospital. \"The situation need not get out of hand like it did.\"\n\nBeing 'held hostage in an American hospital'\n\nWhile the details of Alyssa's case are extraordinary -- the Grandma Betty trick, the escape from the hospital with police on their heels -- the core of her story is not uncommon in many ways, according to patient advocates.\n\nDr. Julia Hallisy, founder of the Empowered Patient Coalition, says families often tell her that a hospital won't allow their loved one to transfer to another facility. Often, they're afraid to say anything publicly or on social media.\n\n\"You sound like a crazy person -- that your family member was held hostage in an American hospital,\" she said. \"People can't believe that would happen. It's like the stuff of a science fiction story.\"\n\nKristen Spyker said it happened to her family.\n\nWhen Spyker's son was born with a rare heart defect, she says she told doctors at the Ohio hospital where he was born that she wanted him to have a surgical repair at a hospital with a larger pediatric heart program.\n\nShe said the heart surgeon at the first hospital refused to send her son's medical records to other hospitals. She also says a surgeon resisted her efforts to transfer her newborn son to another hospital to get a second opinion on what surgery he should have for a rare heart defect.\n\n\"The surgeon said, 'This is my patient. This is my show. I'm the boss, and I say what happens,' \" she said.\n\nShe said a social worker, accompanied by hospital security guards, then came into her son's hospital room and said she was worried that Spyker had postpartum depression that was affecting her ability to make decisions for her son's care.\n\nSpyker said the hospital discharged her son only after she threatened legal action.\n\nHer son then had a successful procedure at another hospital -- a different procedure than the one recommended by the first doctor.\n\nWhen she told her story on Facebook, Spyker said, other parents shared similar stories.\n\n\"It was parent after parent after parent saying 'this happened to us,'\" she said. \"They had been so embarrassed to talk about it, but they felt freer when I said it happened to us.\"\n\nSpyker was one of several people who spoke with Alyssa's parents last year while their daughter was at Mayo.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, the American Hospital Association addressed conflicts between families and hospitals.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Communication between physicians and patients is extremely important in working to identify the best treatment,\" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the organization. \"Each patient is unique. It is for this reason that the majority of hospitals have patient advocates on staff to help patients and families navigate the care process. Hospitals recognize that patients are critical members of any care team and many are employing new strategies to ensure their voice and perspective is heard and accounted for.\"\n\nWhen hospitals and families get into intense conflict, Hallisy, a dentist who practices in San Francisco, says human emotions can run amok. She says she saw it happen when her daughter, Katherine, was being treated for cancer.\n\n\"People think that doctors are immune to petty disagreements, but they're human beings, and sometimes ego and primitive emotions take over,\" she said.\n\nShe said that in Alyssa's case, she wonders whether a sensitive hospital staffer, perhaps a social worker, could have prevented the situation from becoming as contentious as it did.\n\nShe thinks back to her daughter, who died at age 10. She remembers the sadness and fear of having a very sick child, as well as the stress of taking care of her two other children and keeping her dental practice afloat while her daughter was in and out of the hospital.\n\nShe thinks about how Alyssa was near death and how her parents had five younger children 130 miles away, as well as farms and a family business to run.\n\n\"They were under incredible stress,\" Hallisy said. \"They'd almost lost a child, and they had other responsibilities, too. You would think that someone at Mayo would be trained to see that.\"\n\nThe prom queen graduates\n\nMore than a year after leaving the Mayo Clinic, Alyssa, now 20, has belied her \"grim prognosis.\"\n\nThe students of Martin County West High School crowned Alyssa Gilderhus prom queen.\n\nLast year, she graduated from Martin County West High School, receiving a standing ovation from her class. She stayed out all night at her senior prom, where her classmates voted her prom queen. The local chapter of Future Farmers of America gave her the Star Farmer award.\n\nHer feeding tube came out a few months after she left Mayo, and she can eat and speak normally now. She can walk on her own without any assistance. Last summer, she presented her fantail pigeons at the Minnesota State Fair and competed in the poultry princess competition.\n\nShe finished up her physical and speech therapy in March, about a year after leaving Mayo. She'll be a freshman at Southwest Minnesota State University in September.\n\nAlyssa Gilderhus on her family's farm in Sherburn, Minnesota.\n\nAlyssa has not filed a lawsuit, but has engaged Martin, the lawyer who is also representing the Pelletier family.\n\nAlyssa and her parents say they haven't recovered emotionally from what happened at Mayo. They say they still sometimes wake up in the middle of the night, panicked about what would have happened if they hadn't snuck her out of the hospital.\n\n\"I think she would be [at the hospital] and nobody would be able to see her,\" her stepfather said.\n\nThey say Mayo still hasn't given them an explanation for why it was trying to arrange guardianship for Alyssa.\n\nThey think Mayo was trying to get guardianship in retaliation for questioning the staff, especially a senior physician.\n\n\"I think that the doctor I made mad wanted to make sure that I paid for it no matter what,\" her mother said.\n\nShe's told that's a pretty hefty accusation.\n\n\"We stand by it 100 percent,\" her stepfather said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/13/health/mayo-clinic-escape-2-eprise/index.html", "published": "2018-08-13T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Historic face transplant gives suicide survivor a 'second chance'", "text": "(CNN) As Katie Stubblefield brushed her fingers across her face, she could feel the wound.\n\nHer vision is greatly impaired due to her injury, but touching her face allowed her to feel what her doctors were working around the clock to treat.

She could feel the portions that were missing.\n\nThat was before Katie, at 21, became the youngest person in the United States to receive a face transplant. The transplant, performed last year, aims to restore Katie's face structure and functions -- such as chewing, breathing and swallowing -- which were lost in a severe gunshot injury, the haunting outcome of a suicide attempt as a teenager.\n\nNow, Katie hopes to use her historic surgery to raise awareness about the lasting harms of suicide and the precious value of life.\n\nShe is featured on the cover of National Geographic magazine's September issue , which debuted Tuesday, in an article titled \"The Story of a Face\" and in National Geographic's full-length documentary \"Katie's Face.\"\n\n'I had no clue what a face transplant was'\n\nIn the days prior to Katie's suicide attempt, she faced a number of emotional hurdles.\n\nShe underwent surgery for chronic gastrointestinal problems, and she faced betrayal in a personal relationship.

She has said that she doesn't remember much of that year -- including being hospitalized in Oxford, Mississippi; being flown to another hospital in Memphis, Tennessee; and then being transferred to Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, where she would undergo her face transplantation three years later.\n\nIt was in Memphis where Katie's parents, Robb and Alesia, heard the term \"face transplant\" for the first time.\n\n\"There was an older trauma surgeon who basically told us, 'It's the worst wound that I've ever seen of its kind,' and he said, 'The only thing I can think of that would really give her functional life again is a face transplant,' \" Robb said.\n\n\"I was standing there thinking, 'What do you mean, a face transfer? What do you do?' \"\n\nWhen Katie was later told about the possible procedure, she said, she was equally stunned.\n\n\"I had no clue what a face transplant was,\" Katie said. \"When my parents helped explain everything to me, I was very excited to get a face again and to have function again.\"\n\nAt left, Katie Stubblefield at 17, eight months before attempting suicide.

Hide Caption 8 of 8\n\nSimilar to Katie, the first recipient of a face transplant in the United States was a woman who survived a gunshot wound to the head. That patient, Connie Culp, underwent a 22-hour transplant surgery at Cleveland Clinic and debuted her new face in 2009.\n\nThat was a near-total face transplant. The world's first successful full face transplant was conducted at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, in 2010.\n\nAs for where Katie fits in, \"only 40 people in the world have ever had a face transplant, and we believe that she is the 39th person,\" said Susan Goldberg, editor-in-chief of National Geographic magazine\n\n\"We think her story is one of the most important stories that we will do this year,\" Goldberg said of the magazine. \"We thought it was just such a moving and inspiring story that is about everything from human journey to breakthrough medicine and science.\"\n\n'You take it for granted, the different components of our faces'\n\nBefore Katie's face transplantation, surgeons at Cleveland Clinic used 3D printing to help reconstruct about 90% of her lower jaw, said Dr. Brian Gastman, a plastic surgeon at Cleveland Clinic who led Katie's surgery and oversaw her care.\n\nThe surgical team used CT scans of the jaw of Katie's older sister, Olivia McCay, to 3D-print a model template for the reconstruction.\n\n\"We made a plate designed for the combination of Katie and her sister's jaw, and that's what we used to make Katie's jaw before we did the transplant,\" Gastman said.\n\nHe noted that when he first saw Katie's injury, he worried that she might not live.\n\nA surgical resident carefully cradles Katie's head to keep it still as she's situated in the intensive care unit after the 31-hour procedureconcluded. To protect her eyes, her eyelids were sutured shut. With the transplant complete, Katie would still require additional operations and many months of rehabilitation.\n\nIn March 2016, Katie was placed on the waiting list for a face transplant. Fourteen months later, a donor was found: Adrea Schneider, a 31-year-old woman who died of a drug overdose, National Geographic reported. Before the procedure, Katie underwent extensive psychological evaluation as a face transplant candidate and suicide survivor.\n\nAfter she was cleared to receive her new face, the 31-hour surgery began May 4, 2017. It involved 11 surgeons, several other specialists and virtual reality. The surgery was completed the next day.\n\n\"I am able to touch my face now, and it feels amazing,\" said Katie, who still has some difficulty speaking clearly.\n\nHer father, Robb, translated some of her sentiments: \"You take it for granted, the different components of our faces -- the bone, the tissue, the muscle, everything -- but when it's gone, you recognize the big need. Then when you receive a transplant, you're so thankful.\"\n\nNine months and 22 days before Katie's face transplant, at Cleveland's Tudor Arms Hotel, Katie and her father sing \"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\" as they share a dance. \"Before this, I never spent so much time with my parents,\" said Katie, who credits their love and devotion with helping to save her life.\n\nKatie was discharged from Cleveland Clinic on August 1, 2017. She takes immunosuppressive drugs to reduce her risk of transplant rejection , which occurs when a transplant recipient's immune system attacks the transplanted organ or tissue. She will continue to take the medication for the rest of her life.\n\nKatie also continues physical and occupational therapy, works with a speech therapist and takes Braille lessons.\n\nJUST WATCHED Face transplant recipient meets donor's family Replay More Videos ...

A grant from the US Department of Defense, through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine , covered Katie's transplant, according to National Geographic. The institute works to develop advanced treatment options -- including face transplantation -- for severely wounded servicemen and -women.\n\n\"I remember Dr. Gastman mentioned to me, he said basically that Katie was kind of the quintessential potential candidate for a face transplant. One, because of the type of wound that she suffered, but also she is in that age bracket of so many soldiers,\" Robb said. \"She's in that late-teen to early 20s, where so many young soldiers are being wounded and injured.\"\n\nWhile Katie's medical care team hopes that her surgery can advance the field of face transplantation, there are many other hopes for her future.\n\nJUST WATCHED Man with face transplant speaks about transformation Replay More Videos ...

She hopes to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention.\n\n\"My first wish for Katie is to be happy,\" Gastman said.\n\n\"That's number one, but beyond that, I'd like her to have some level of normalcy,\" he said. \"Then, she can do all that and become a spokeswoman for so many aspects -- for how to be strong in the face of adversity and not to make a singular decision dictate who you are. Further, on the other hand, how much a singular rash decision made by so many young people today could negatively change your whole life.\"\n\nHe said Katie \"had the ultimate second chance.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSuicide awareness remains critical, said Katie's mother, Alesia.\n\nGlobally, close to 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, which is about one person every 40 seconds, according to the World Health Organization\n\nIn 2016, guns were the most common method used in suicide deaths in the US, accounting for 22,963 -- almost half of all -- suicide deaths, according to the National Institute of Mental Health\n\nAmong young people, \"I think we do a pretty decent job of educating them about sex and about drinking and driving,\" but education around suicide prevention is lacking, Alesia said.\n\n\"I can honestly tell you, for Katie, we do not believe for one moment that she wanted to die,\" Alesia said. \"But we do believe she hit that low where she definitely tried and thought about it, and for a moment -- 20 seconds or less -- kids can make those decisions.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/14/health/face-transplant-suicide-attempt-natgeo-profile/index.html", "published": "2018-08-14T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Essure: Bayer paid doctors millions for questionable birth control device", "text": "Petersburg, Indiana (CNN) When Christina Potts was looking for permanent birth control, she said, her doctor was a \"cheerleader\" for one option and one option only: Essure.\n\nPotts says the device, which is implanted in a woman's fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching an egg, left her in terrible pain and extremely fatigued.\n\nIt was so bad that she had a hysterectomy, removing her uterus and tubes to get rid of Essure.\n\nLast week, the US Food and Drug Administration expressed safety concerns about Essure, and Bayer Pharmaceuticals announced that it would pull the device off the market at the end of the year.\n\nPotts says she'll always wonder this: Did her former gynecologist recommend Essure because it was best for her or because Bayer paid the doctor tens of thousands of dollars?\n\nA CNN analysis of federal data, shows that from August 2013 through December 2017, Bayer paid 11,850 doctors $2.5 million related to Essure for consulting fees and similar services.\n\nThese payments are legal but very controversial.\n\nPotts' doctor was one of the highest earners, according to federal data. Dr. Cindy Basinski was paid $168,068 for consulting fees and similar services from August 2013 through the end of 2017.\n\nMore than 80% of the money that Bayer paid to Indiana doctors for Essure was paid to her. Nationally, she was the second highest-paid doctor for the service, one of just three doctors to earn more than $100,000.\n\nThe financial information comes from a federal database that covers August 2013 through the end of last year. Basinski said she also received payments related to Essure for about five years before that, but the database doesn't go back that far, and Basinski says she doesn't remember what she was paid during those years.\n\n\"I will tell you that my best guess is that early on it was very minimal, $5,000 to $7,000 a year,\" she said.\n\nBasinski says she's so convinced of Essure's safety that she'll continue to implant it into women until the device comes off the market.\n\nDr. Cindy Basinski said \"I did a lot of work to earn that money. A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.\"\n\nIn those studies, the payments are typically much more modest than what Basinski has received. But the gynecologist said her clinical judgment hasn't been swayed by the money.\n\n\"I will say that I do not feel that it influenced me at all in any way,\" she said.\n\nShe said she could have earned the same amount if she'd been seeing patients during the hours she was paid by Bayer to educate doctors about the device and how to implant it.\n\n\"I think that there can be professional relationships with companies and physicians. I did a lot of work to earn that money,\" she said. \"A majority of activities were involved with educating physicians.\"\n\nShe added that she's turned down money -- in some cases more than Bayer paid her -- because she did not believe in a certain product.\n\nBayer announced last week that declining sales is the reason it will pull the device off the market and that it stands by the safety of its product.\n\nBut according to a US Food and Drug Administration statement put out the same day, the device has been associated with \"serious risks including persistent pain, perforation of the uterus and fallopian tubes, and migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen.\"\n\nBayer's announcement came just days before Netflix premiered a documentary about the dangers of Essure and other medical devices, \"The Bleeding Edge.\"\n\nOn Friday, Bayer posted a \"fact check\" to the documentary, which states that the film \"presents an inaccurate and misleading picture of Essure.\"\n\nAlso Friday, the pharmaceutical company published an \"Open Letter to Patients and Providers About Essure,\" which states that the company's decision to stop selling Essure \"was not based on concerns about the safety and efficacy of Essure. Essure has been on the market for more than 15 years and has been successfully used by hundreds of thousands of women.\"\n\nThe Netflix documentary features a group of women who lobbied Congress for years to get Essure off the market.\n\nTheir private Facebook group, Essure Problems, has more than 37,000 members, including more than 12,000 women who say they've had a hysterectomy or other surgical procedure to remove the device, according to group founder Angie Firmalino.\n\n'I felt like she was very pushy'\n\nWhen Potts, who teaches children with special needs in Petersburg, Indiana, gave birth to twins Eli and Brena in 2006, she and her husband knew that they wanted permanent birth control. With four children -- they have an older daughter and son -- their family was complete.\n\nPotts, then 27, asked Basinski about getting her fallopian tubes tied, but she says Basinski told her that wasn't a good choice for a woman with four young children, because it involved recovery time from the surgery. Essure could be implanted vaginally right in the office, in a procedure much like a routine Pap smear.\n\nChristina Potts had a hysterectomy to remove her Essure device.\n\n\"She was very upbeat about it,\" Potts said. \"I felt like she was very pushy.\"\n\nShe and other patients who saw Basinski told CNN that the doctor seemed like a cheerleader for Essure. Potts said that's why she didn't call Basinski when she developed headaches, joint pain, abdominal cramping and extreme fatigue about a year after she got the implant.\n\nShe said she felt so sick that she had to rely on her oldest child, then 8, to help with her three younger children.\n\n\"It was hard,\" she said.\n\nSince the hysterectomy, her symptoms have almost completely gone away, she said.\n\nPotts says she's angry that, in her memory, Basinski dismissed having her tubes tied, also known as tubal ligation, the other option for permanent female birth control.\n\nShe felt \"violated\" because she felt that her choice was taken away.\n\n\"I felt like it was Dr. Basinski's decision, more or less, because she said that this was best, and I wasn't really given another option,\" she said.\n\nBasinski said she couldn't recall her conversation with Potts, but said she felt Potts was not remembering the conversation correctly. She said she routinely gives patients options for sterilization procedures.\n\n\"In my notes I did document that I talked about risks, benefits, and alternatives with her,\" Basinski said.\n\nAnother patient said Basinski also dismissed tubal ligation as an option in favor of Essure. That patient, who requested not to be named to protect her privacy, later went to a different doctor to have a hysterectomy to remove the device.\n\nBasinski says that if it seems to her patients that she stresses Essure, that's only because it's a relatively new device -- it was approved by the FDA in 2002 -- and so it requires more explanation.\n\n\"We go through all of the options and all of the risks and benefits,\" she said. \"It is my obligation to offer patients all available products on the marketplace, explain the risks and benefits and why they may want to choose one or the other.\"\n\nBut Potts and other patients say Basinski's marketing puts that claim into question. She's had YouTube videos, a website and a highway billboard all devoted to Essure.\n\nIn 2009, she appeared on \"The Balancing Act,\" a television show aimed at women, along with Trista Sutter, a former \"Bachelorette\" contestant who had been implanted with the device.\n\nThe host asked about the popularity and risks of Essure.\n\n\"Well, I'm going to tell you something, because of Miss Trista here, I think we're going to have women flocking to the doctor's office to get Essure,\" Basinski said. \"When women find out about this, they want this procedure.\"\n\nCNN spoke to two of her former patients who were pleased with Essure.\n\n\"Knowing Dr. Basinski, I don't believe that she would ever be biased in leading a patient towards something that she didn't feel was appropriate for them,\" said Cindy Dossett, who was implanted with Essure in 2008. \"I have always trusted her judgment. She has never given me any reason not to, and I wouldn't say that about all doctors.\"\n\n'That looks like a bribe'\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Bayer said that \"close cooperation with, and continuous education of, healthcare professionals is key to achieving better outcomes for the patients we strive to help.\"\n\nThe statement added that health care professionals \"are compensated for their expertise and the services they provide to the pharmaceutical industry. It is appropriate and ethical for Bayer to compensate medical professionals for the time they spend on these activities.\"\n\nFriday Bayer provided CNN a document outlining the company's procedures for Essure related payments to outside medical experts. \"These agreements between Bayer and its consulting physicians do not compensate them for the use of Essure,\" it states. \"They are not being paid by Bayer to purchase, prescribe, or otherwise support Essure.\"\n\nDr. Martin Makary, a professor of surgery and patient safety expert at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said that although it's ethical for a pharmaceutical company to pay a doctor for genuine research, he doubted that the more than 11,000 doctors paid by Bayer were involved in such efforts.\n\n\"That looks like a bribe,\" he said. \"That looks like gaming the system. That looks like the pharma company is paying off doctors.\"\n\nData on Essure\n\nThe FDA estimates that Essure has been used by more than 750,000 patients worldwide since it was approved on November 4, 2002. At the time, Essure was manufactured and marketed by Conceptus Inc., which Bayer acquired in June 2013.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2017, the patient problems most frequently reported to the FDA were pain/abdominal pain (21,215), heavier menses/menstrual irregularities (9,846), headache (7,231), fatigue (5,842) and weight fluctuations (4,970).\n\nAccording to the FDA , reported adverse events \"cannot be interpreted or used in isolation to reach conclusions about the existence, severity or frequency of problems associated with devices\" and \"confirming whether a device actually caused a specific event can be difficult based solely on information provided in a given report.\"\n\nIn April, the FDA restricted sales of Essure to only doctors who give patients FDA-approved patient education materials that describe the risks.\n\nBasinski says she wishes women could keep getting Essure beyond the end of this year.\n\n\"I think it is a safe and viable option for women, and I'm very sad that it's not available in the marketplace after December of 2018 for women [for whom] this may be the right option,\" she said.\n\nCNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/27/health/essure-bayer-doctor-payments-eprise/index.html", "published": "2018-07-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Two dads, an egg donor and a surrogate: How a freezer failure changed everything", "text": "San Francisco, California (CNN) Their first date was over lunch during a Proposition 8 protest, where they joined hundreds of others railing against the passage of California's same-sex marriage ban. The two men took a break from demonstrating, threw their hearts on the table and talked about their desire to have kids.\n\nSo it was somehow appropriate that in June 2013, nearly five years later, Bill Taroli and Yang Li stood in a delivery room and welcomed their son, Henry, one day before the US Supreme Court overturned Prop 8. A couple weeks later, with their newborn in their arms, they exchanged vows and were legally married.\n\nHaving Henry required careful and complicated planning over the course of several years. To become fathers, they needed a support group, legal help, extensive research, reams of documents, reproductive science and about $150,000. But none of that mattered without the help of two women: an egg donor and a surrogate.\n\nOne embryo brought them Henry. Five remaining healthy embryos they kept frozen in storage at the Pacific Fertility Center in San Francisco. They imagined the sibling they might someday give their son and stayed in touch with the women who'd helped give them life once -- and might again someday.\n\n\n\nThen came the news in March. A freezer or cryogenic storage tank at the facility failed, causing the level of liquid nitrogen to dip too low and the temperature to rise. The malfunction jeopardized the status of thousands of eggs and embryos inside, potentially crushing the dreams of hundreds of hopeful parents and families.\n\nThe fate of their embryos would prove significant not just for the fathers but for the women invested in their journey.\n\nThe eggs she wasn't using\n\nTaroli, 47, was adopted by his stepfather and was 20 when he first met his biological dad. When he considered pathways to fatherhood, he was open to a variety of options.\n\nLi, however, was keen on having a biological child, making the decision of how to proceed easy, Taroli said. Henry \"got his sperm and my name.\"\n\nThey scrolled through a registry of possible egg donors provided by the fertility center, studying pictures and written statements. They settled on \"Isabelle,\" a name chosen by the potential donor, and elected to sit down with her in person.\n\nShe was a college student living in Sacramento when she spotted an ad about egg donation. She didn't need to do it financially, as she had family support and scholarships, but she liked the idea of extra spending money and looked ahead toward medical school and the enormous expenses to come.\n\nIsabelle, the name she preferred to go by for this story, also thought about how fixated she was on not getting pregnant, and her mind turned to those who wanted nothing more.\n\n\"Some people are tying so hard to not have something that other people would absolutely love to have happen to them,\" she said by Skype from the United Kingdom, where she's beyond medical school and now doing her residency in Wales. \"I thought, 'I have these eggs. I'm not using them. Someone might as well.'\"\n\nShe also liked the idea of taking part in social innovation and helping families who, without someone else's eggs, might never have children.\n\nIsabelle's mother was befuddled by and against her daughter's decision to donate eggs.\n\n\"No, no, no -- don't do it,\" Isabelle remembered her pleading. \"What's the point?\"\n\nShe ended up going through six egg donation cycles and received $7,000 to $8,000 each time, she said. She was fascinated by the science of it all. Her pre-med friends lined up to give her hormone injections.\n\nMost of her donation cycles went directly to a frozen egg bank, where they'd be used by people she'd never know or meet. But her first cycle, the experience she appreciated most, went to two men who chose her.\n\nShe was excited to meet the people \"who wanted my eggs to be part of their family,\" she said. When they got together in the clinic offices, Taroli did most of the talking and peppered Isabelle with questions. Li, who didn't want to speak for this story, sat by with a clipboard, she remembered. The few questions Li asked were specific: He wanted to know what it was like to grow up bilingual and multicultural.\n\nIsabelle, now 29, has a Portuguese mother and an American father. Henry has American and Chinese dads. And although their backgrounds are different from those of her parents, the couple saw in Isabelle a commonality. She walked away struck by their kindness and thinking how lucky any child of theirs would be.\n\nCapable but 'not interested in carrying my own'\n\nThey came to know their embryos well, including their sexes, through chromosomal testing and biopsies of their cells. Taroli explained that they received rankings, which measured their viability, and the ones they stored -- including the one that would become Henry -- represented their best chances to become parents.\n\nNext, Taroli and Li had to identify their surrogate.\n\nA traditional surrogate is implanted with embryos using her own eggs, but Taroli and Li opted for a gestational carrier, a surrogate who receives through in-vitro fertilization an embryo using somebody else's eggs. The latter process, if they chose a carrier who also lived in California, would be less legally complicated for the gay dads, Taroli explained. The woman's name would not appear on Henry's birth certificate. Instead, both of their names would.\n\nA few hours north of Castro Valley, the community in the East Bay where Taroli and Li live, the woman who would become their surrogate and her husband were happy to be parents to an only child. But she comes from a big family, in which the women generally have five or six kids, and her pregnancy had been \"really, really easy,\" she said.\n\nAn article she read about surrogacy got her thinking. Though pregnancy had been such a breeze for her, she knew that having a family was often a struggle for others. She thought about how some women feel attached to their babies while they're in the womb and how she didn't. It wasn't until after her son was born that she made a connection.\n\nThe surrogate asked to be identified as \"Audrey\" to protect her privacy.\n\n\"I felt emotionally capable of being a surrogate. I felt physically capable,\" Audrey said. \"It seems kind of a waste that I'm so able to carry children but not interested in carrying my own.\"\n\nHer husband, whom she's been with for more than 16 years, also didn't want more children but was in full support of this idea. His mother, Audrey said, was initially disappointed because she still held out hope that they'd give her more grandkids. Audrey's mother and grandmother, however, were completely on board.\n\nIt was her father, divorced from her mother and living several states away, who had the hardest time understanding. The thought of his daughter delivering somebody else's baby, and being part of a process that might include the destruction of embryos, went against his faith. But the two of them had weathered points of friction before, and Audrey, then 30, was prepared to move forward.\n\nIt wasn't about the money for her, although the $27,000 came in handy for the then stay-at-home mom.\n\nShe'd done research into how surrogacy worked and signed up with a surrogacy agency. There were questionnaires for her and her husband to complete, a psychological evaluation she had to clear and medical records that needed to be shared. She suspected that being a surrogate for a woman might become emotionally fraught and was most interested in being a surrogate for a gay couple. She also welcomed the chance to have an ongoing relationship after the birth.\n\nThe agency learned about Taroli and Li and set up a meeting.\n\nWith her husband and 3-year-old son with her, Audrey walked into the family-style restaurant the surrogacy agency had selected. It was initially awkward, sort of like heading into a blind date, she said.\n\n\"They brought me flowers, which was really sweet,\" she remembered. \"You could tell how much they were trying to impress me.\"\n\nLike her husband who works in IT, so does Taroli; Li is in software development. Their initial shyness was something she understood and liked. As they warmed up, they shared their histories, and the two men spoke openly about their hope to be fathers. They told her that they liked the idea of staying in contact with their surrogate, not just during the pregnancy but after, a proposition that made her smile.\n\nShe left feeling like, in them, she'd found her match.\n\n'Not just a vessel for their child'\n\nAfter some additional testing at the fertility center, Audrey and the couple began to iron out a legal contract.\n\nShe laid out what she was -- and wasn't -- comfortable with. She wanted to pick her own doctor and hospital. No more than two embryos could be implanted in her, she said, and she was relieved when they decided to go with just one. She planned to work with a doula, did not want an epidural and would consider a cesarean section only if the doctor deemed it necessary.\n\nEating healthy foods and not smoking were conditions she already chose to live by. And she and her husband would abstain from sexual intercourse in the weeks right before and after the embryo transfer, to make sure she was having Taroli and Li's baby -- not hers.\n\nFor many people, in vitro fertilization requires repeated tries -- and additional costs -- to work, if it works at all. The first embryo implanted in Audrey took without a hitch.\n\nShe, Taroli and Li were in touch by email a few times a week, and the dads came along to some of her doctor appointments. They got together at least once a month and came to know each other as her belly grew. Sometimes when they'd visit, the two men would take her and her family out to dinner.\n\n\"They really valued me,\" Audrey said. \"They saw me as a person, not just a vessel for their child.\"\n\nShe recalled how her own child took the developments in stride. When he was nearly 4 and she was very pregnant, someone asked her son, \"Aren't you excited you're going to be a brother?\"\n\nThe young boy answered, without skipping a beat, \"That's not going to be my brother. That's Bill and Yang's baby.\"\n\nAs her contractions grew stronger in the Redding delivery room, she held off on pushing and screamed out, \"Are the dads here? Are they here?\" A nurse rushed Taroli and Li in from the waiting room. They were there to witness Henry's arrival and cut his umbilical cord.\n\nAudrey and her husband, who was also in the room, watched as the two new dads fussed with how to put on the first diaper.\n\n\"They were so funny,\" Audrey, now 36, remembered. \"They were being a little snippy with each other. I'm sure I was like that with my son, and it was so cute to see that in someone else.\"\n\nAudrey pumped breast milk for Henry for 10 months and stopped sending the UPS shipments on dry ice only once Taroli and Li had enough to get them through their son's first year.\n\nShe and her family visited Henry's family quite a bit in the beginning. They saw them on Christmas and were at the boy's first birthday party. They've since moved to Los Angeles, where Audrey works as a speech therapist. It's been a couple years since they've seen each other, but they still get updates and pictures.\n\n'He's not my son'\n\nIsabelle and Audrey have not met but have heard about each other. They each received photo books Taroli and Li created to document Henry's first year and how he came into this world. They receive updates and additional photographs, still. And, as a result, they've seen pictures of one another, as they're both central to Henry's story.\n\nIsabelle remembers being a little thrown by the first photograph she spotted of Audrey.\n\n\"I remember thinking, she had my egg inside of her,\" she said. \"That's just crazy.\"\n\nIsabelle didn't see Taroli and Li again until Henry was about a 1\u00bd. The couple reached out to the clinic to say they wanted her to meet Henry.\n\n\"I wanted him to have the opportunity to know who was involved in his coming into being,\" said Taroli, who didn't learn that he was adopted until he was 14.\n\nThe clinic, in turn, put the query to Isabelle. She was living in the UK at the time but would be returning to California for Christmas.\n\nIsabelle's mother, who had opposed her daughter's decision to donate eggs, suddenly couldn't wait for her chance to meet the boy.\n\nThat would come later. The first visit with Taroli, Li and Henry was Isabelle's alone.\n\nAs she drove across the Golden Gate Bridge, she began to grow nervous. She was fresh off a breakup, emotionally raw and worried that she might see Henry and suddenly want him. She feared that she'd lay eyes on him and believe, \"This is my baby,\" she said.\n\n\"But then, when I got there and I saw Henry, he couldn't have cared less,\" she said with a laugh. \"I was just another person in the room. Yes, he's genetically my son, but he's not my son. He was more interested in the tissue box than me.\"\n\nShe tries to see them whenever she's in California and appreciates the photos they send her. Her mother gushes over pictures of Henry and \"is probably more attached to him than I am,\" Isabelle said.\n\nSometimes she wonders, if Taroli and Li had had a girl, whether she would have seen herself more in the child. She knew that there was a female embryo in the tank and thought about what might come later.\n\nTaroli and Li told her, at one point, that if she ever found herself single or struggling to get pregnant, she was welcome to use embryos they didn't use.\n\n\"It would be quite ironic, wouldn't it?\" asked Isabelle, who faces years of continued medical training and hopes to be an obstetrician-gynecologist some day. The option of using their embryos, if she needed them someday, stayed in the back of her mind.\n\nAn ocean between them\n\nTaroli was texting with his mom, with his television on in the background, when a national story caught his eye. He recognized the lobby of the Pacific Fertility Clinic but thought it was just generic footage, he said, to complement a report on a failed fertility clinic storage tank in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHe had to rewind and watch the piece three or four times before the truth sunk in. The very same weekend that Cleveland experienced a tank malfunction, so did San Francisco.\n\nHe fired off an email to the fertility clinic, not knowing whether this freezer failure affected them. Li, who is establishing a new business in China, was abroad, so Taroli sent him a message, too, with a link to the TV segment.\n\nA day or two later, Taroli said, he got a late evening call from the clinic, confirming that their embryos were in the ill-fated tank. To find out whether the embryos were destroyed, however, would take further testing.\n\nTo test an embryo requires that it be thawed first, which -- in turn -- might damage the embryo, Taroli explained. He and Li decided they would approve testing, one embryo at a time. If the first was still OK, they could hope that the others were, too.\n\n\"So we did that,\" Taroli said over coffee in April. \"They all came back dead.\"\n\nWith thousands of miles and the Pacific Ocean between them, the couple processed what this meant for them.\n\n\"They were viable lives. They were potential babies, four boys and a girl, that if we chose to could have been our kids,\" Taroli said. \"It's not about the death of a child; it's not the same thing. ... It's the death of the possibility.\"\n\nAnd it's the death of what might have been for Henry, who'd lost the chance to have biological siblings.\n\nTaroli was playing the role of solo parent during Li's China trip. He got choked up when he spoke about their son, who recently turned 5, and the extra big hugs he was getting.\n\n\"If I get upset, he cries,\" Taroli said. \"I've been careful not to talk about it in front of him.\"\n\nBreaking the news\n\nIt was important to Taroli to break the news to Isabelle and Audrey. They were part of the fertility journey from the start, and they deserved to know how it ended.\n\nBefore he got to Isabelle, though, she got an email from the Pacific Fertility Clinic. The clinic wanted to know, out of the blue, whether she'd be open to donating eggs again. She explained where she now lived but said she'd be interested if they wanted to talk. She got a call almost immediately.\n\nIf the clinic wanted to fly her to California or could wait until she was there for a visit, she said, she'd be willing to go through a donation cycle, she said. She was told they'd reach out again if they needed her.\n\nThe exchange got her thinking about Henry and her experience. She talked to a friend about it that night and wondered aloud about how big Henry must be.\n\nWhen she woke up at 4 a.m., she said, she had an email from Taroli, telling her about the storage tank failure. She began to wonder whether the clinic had only called her because it had lost her eggs and their embryos. Taroli too found the timing odd. Why would they reach out to Isabelle without knowing whether he and Li were even interested in going through this again, he wondered.\n\nThe clinic, contacted several times for clarification on this and other questions, would not comment for this story.\n\nThe news of the lost embryos both shocked and saddened Isabelle.\n\n\"For some reason, I kept thinking about the little girl egg,\" she said, and the potential that was lost for all the embryos. \"They would never become people. But then, I guess, we always knew that they wouldn't all ever become real people, right?\"\n\nIsabelle told Taroli that if he and Li ever wanted to try again, her eggs were theirs.\n\nAudrey's heart sunk too for the couple when she got the news from Taroli. She knew from a previous conversation that they were on the fence about when -- or if -- they'd have a second child, but she hated that the option was taken away from them.\n\nBecause her experience with Taroli and Li was so wonderful, Audrey went on to be a gestational carrier once more a few years later. But the second time she did it for an opposite-sex couple, and the experience was awful in comparison. That couple demanded that doctors speak only to them and wanted to manage all aspects of her life. Audrey felt like nothing more than a vessel.\n\nAfter that, she said, she couldn't imagine being a surrogate again -- unless it was for Taroli and Li.\n\n\"They were so great, and I love them so much,\" Audrey said. \"I would do it a million times over again for them.\"\n\nTaroli and Li knew this.\n\n'Happy with where we are'\n\nPacific Fertility Center formally offered to cover all costs for another round, and their doctor, whom they don't blame in any way, was eager to have them go through the process again.\n\nBut Taroli and Li, after processing the shock, mourning the loss and coming to terms with where their lives are now, have decided they aren't interested in going through this again.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThey're getting older, they love their life with Henry, Li's new business in China will require lots of travel and time apart, and now is not the time for them to have more children.\n\nThe truth is, they may have never used those embryos, but they would have liked to make that decision on their own terms.\n\n\"If we were really eager to have a second child still or didn't have Henry yet, our thinking might have been different,\" Taroli said. \"We're happy with where we are.\"\n\nMeantime, attorneys are signing on clients for lawsuits against the clinic, but Taroli said they can't imagine dragging this out. They don't need to take part to find closure. Yes, they want to understand what went wrong with the tank that held their embryos, most of all because they want to be sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\"I work in tech, where lives aren't on the line,\" Taroli said. \"You improve your process and put something better in place until the next thing you couldn't anticipate happens.\"\n\nHe doesn't judge those who are seeking legal remedies, and he knows that for some, for instance those who froze embryos before undergoing treatment for cancer, what happened is a tragedy of different proportions.\n\nBut for him and Li, they will love the child they do have, stay honest with Henry about where he came from and give him every chance to know the women who helped him get here.\n\nAnd someday, when the time is right and he asks why he never had siblings, they'll find the words to explain.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/28/health/embryos-egg-donor-surrogate/index.html", "published": "2018-06-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Medicine for her diabetes kept her alive -- and it was killing her, too", "text": "Columbia, South Carolina (CNN) Emmy Reeves shows off the My Little Pony mural she painted in her sister's room.\n\nShe points out other displays of her work around the family home: a portrait of a cat, a painting of a hillside overlooking Lake Superior, a small sculpture of her riding a wolf.\n\nAt 13, Emmy has undergone an awakening.\n\nJust months ago, she struggled with the rarest of conditions: She was a child with Type 1 diabetes who was allergic to the insulin shots she needed to stay alive.\n\nShe was given an array of antihistamines to dampen her allergic reactions as a means of survival. But the result was that she slept about 20 hours a day -- and the possibility of dying from her daily insulin remained.\n\nThe very medicine she needed to stay alive was slowly killing her.\n\n\"It's horrifying to know that every day, you would give your child a medicine that, in essence, could kill them,\" mother Tiffanie Reeves said. \"It's just really scary.\"\n\nFor Emmy, every insulin injection felt like fire spreading through her body, from her fingertips to her toes. When her parents tried to hug her, she'd flinch because the pain was unbearable.\n\nThe first time she was given an insulin shot, she stopped breathing, fainted and was rushed to the hospital. She was just 4 years old. In the months after, her parents held her down for every insulin shot. She'd scream and shout, \"I'll be a good girl!\"\n\n\"We have to do this because we love you. This is what keeps you alive,\" her parents would say.\n\nFor nine years, she suffered like this. Beyond the pain, she developed cataracts and often broke out into extreme rashes. She was medicated so much, she struggled with memory and an array of other issues.\n\nHer parents tried everything. They took Emmy to top medical institutions and spoke with insulin companies to get the least amount of preservatives in her insulin, because that's what they believed was causing the allergic reactions. Nothing seemed to work.\n\nDesperate, her father wrote an email last year to Dr. Raja Kandaswamy, one of the nation's pre-eminent pancreas transplant surgeons. \"Her quality of life is degrading faster than we had hoped, so now we are looking for a solution that will allow her to stop needing insulin, while we find a solution to her allergy,\" Jack Reeves wrote.\n\nMore than 1 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to allow sugar to enter cells to produce energy. For most children, the condition is managed through insulin injections and a close monitoring of their blood sugar levels. It is exceedingly rare for a child to have an insulin allergy on the magnitude as Emmy.\n\nEmmy's father wasn't looking for a cure for her diabetes. He was simply hoping to give his daughter an improved quality of life to help manage her diabetes. Her parents feared that she would die within a year if she stayed on the same course of treatment.\n\nEmmy Reeves holds her cat and a stuffed pancreas. She recently underwent a pancreas transplant that has transformed her life.\n\nBut that email set in motion a chain of events, resulting in the nation's sole pancreas transplant of a child this young in nearly 25 years. It also led to his daughter being cured of her diabetes.\n\n\"It's amazing. She's a totally different child,\" her mother said. \"Every day that she does not reject this organ, I'm going to hug her, even though she may get tired of Mommy hugging her.\"\n\n'You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling'\n\nKandaswamy, the director of the pancreas transplant program at University of Minnesota Health, remembers receiving the email from Emmy's father \"like it was yesterday.\"\n\nKandaswamy, who has two daughters himself, felt the pain of a father who desperately wanted help for his child. But there was little medical literature to guide or support a pancreatic transplant in a child. There have been other cases in which children receive a new pancreas, but those transplants are usually done in conjunction with kidney and intestine transplants.\n\nOnly nine children have received a sole pancreas transplant, Kandaswamy said. The last time a pancreas transplant was done in a child this young, he said, was nearly 25 years ago. That transplant was performed at the University of Minnesota in 1994 on an 11-year-old boy by Kandaswamy's mentor, Dr. David Sutherland, who is considered the father of pancreatic transplants. Unfortunately, that pancreas only lasted six months in the boy.\n\n\"Pancreas transplants are generally just not done on children,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\nBut his mentor taught him to always put a loved one in that patient's place and ask yourself, \" 'What would you do if it was your mother or your daughter who needed the care?' Ask that question, and you will get your answer.\"\n\nKandaswamy said that's exactly what he did when Emmy first visited. \"I have two daughters of my own. One of them is very close in age to Emmy,\" he said. \"Looking at her, you could see: 'Hey, if this was your daughter, what would you do?'\n\n\"You couldn't touch her skin without her recoiling,\" said Kandaswamy, who is also a professor in the department of surgery at the university's medical school. \"Her quality of life was just deteriorating to the point that this was a cycle that would not be compatible for long-term survival.\"\n\nHe had to educate others in the hospital about why he felt the transplant would work for a child. The university had a new pediatric hospital, and if the surgery didn't go as planned, the institution's reputation could be adversely impacted.\n\n\"There was a huge amount of apprehension,\" Kandaswamy said. \"I knew we were taking a big risk in that this may not go well.\"\n\nA team of more than a dozen doctors was put together to study Emmy's case: surgeons, anesthesiologists, nephrologists, allergists, transplant coordinators, pain management specialists and others.\n\nAfter a four-day assessment in April 2017 at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children's Hospital, they agreed that a full pancreas transplant was the best option of giving her a better quality of life.\n\n\"We didn't make the decision without due thought and process,\" Kandaswamy said. \"We had to do it because of the extenuating circumstances here.\"\n\nKandaswamy felt that in the nearly 25 years since that first pancreas transplant on a child, the surgical techniques and post-transplant management have advanced to the point that his team could \"successfully perform a transplant in a child this young.\"\n\nA healthy pancreas would allow her body to naturally produce insulin -- effectively curing her diabetes -- but the surgery carried many risks, including the possibility her body would reject the organ.\n\n\"Pediatric patients, they have very active immune systems, and they will try to spit out any kind of organ,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\nEmmy and her mother would also need to move to Minnesota from South Carolina to be near the hospital the moment a pancreas became available.\n\nBefore she headed north, though, Emmy created a bucket list: eat jambalaya in Louisiana, feast on a steak in Texas, visit the Grand Canyon and see her friends from diabetes camp in California, where she once lived.\n\nThe family hit the road. Emmy got to do everything on her list.\n\nIt was, her parents say, a farewell trip, should she not survive.\n\nFalse alarms and the magic moment\n\nEmmy and her mother arrived in Minnesota on July 15. They settled into the Ronald McDonald House, where families stay for free during visits at the hospital. They then had to wait for a pancreas to become available.\n\nThree times, the calls came that an organ might be available. Each time turned out to be a false alarm. The second was on Thanksgiving.\n\nAt one low point, Emmy suffered a severe allergic reaction in January; she stopped breathing and had to be rushed into emergency care. Still, she battled on.\n\nThen came the moment. On the afternoon of February 9, Kandaswamy called Emmy's mother with news that a pancreas was available. Emmy was watching a documentary about wolves, her favorite animal, with her tutor at a museum.\n\nMom let her finish watching the film and then told her it was time. They needed to rush back, gather up some belongings and get to the hospital. When they got to the Ronald McDonald House, the place was abuzz. Word had spread like wildfire that Emmy's moment had arrived. Families and staff cheered them on and wished them well.\n\nAt the hospital, Kandaswamy greeted them in the lobby. He explained that a procurement team had gone to get the organ about an hour away in St. Cloud -- that there was still a possibility it might not be a proper fit but that he was optimistic.\n\nEmmy's mother, Tiffanie Reeves, clutched Ducky throughout the transplant. The stuffed animal was given to Emmy when she was first diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.\n\nEmmy was prepped for the surgery so she would be ready when the pancreas arrived.\n\nAbout 3 a.m., Kandaswamy conferenced in Jack, who was back in South Carolina with Emmy's younger sister. \"I think we are going to go ahead. The organ looks good,\" he said.\n\nOn Emmy's 210th day in Minnesota, the transplant began. That number isn't lost on the family: She was wheeled into the operating room on 2/10.\n\nAs Emmy underwent surgery, Mom clutched a tattered yellow stuffed animal named Ducky, who was given to Emmy after she was diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nThe surgery took more than four hours. \"It was a great, great feeling when we got her done,\" Kandaswamy said. \"But I knew in my mind that the job was only half done. We were excited but also cautiously optimistic at that point.\"\n\nThe doctors had to make sure the new pancreas -- what Emmy nicknamed \"Player 2\" -- worked properly, that her body didn't reject it and that her body could tolerate the immunosuppressive drugs she needed after the transplant.\n\nShe responded well the first week, but in the second week after the transplant, her body began to reject the organ. Her immune system saw it as foreign and tried to attack it.\n\n\"I had to come and tell her that her body is in rejection,\" her mother said. \"We're not sure what's going to happen in the future.\"\n\nThey decided to try a stronger immunosuppressant. \"We're already down the rabbit hole, Mom. We gotta do what we gotta do,\" Emmy said.\n\nEver since, her pancreas has functioned as hoped.\n\nDr. Melina Bellin, the pediatric endocrinologist with University of Minnesota Health who worked with Emmy, said it was \"touch-and-go\" early on, but everyone was relieved when Emmy's health turned around.\n\n\"It's particularly rewarding when you're at that point in the beginning when you're not 100% sure it's going to turn out the way you wanted,\" she said. \"It definitely makes it that much better when it does.\"\n\nKandaswamy added, \"We were able to treat it effectively and got it turned around.\"\n\nWith the healthy new pancreas, he said, her diabetes has been cured. She no longer needs insulin shots or the antihistamines that she was taking to try to limit her allergic reactions. The hospital slowly weaned her off all of those medications that were making her extremely drowsy and \"blunting her consciousness,\" Kandaswamy said.\n\n\"Then we saw the real Emmy. She started really blossoming,\" he said. \"It's like a cloud has been lifted off her consciousness so she can actually express all of this stuff in a big way.\"\n\nOne of the greatest moments of his career, Kandaswamy said, was when Emmy hugged him: \"There was nothing more fulfilling than seeing her walk up, give me a hug and say, 'I want to go back home.' It's the greatest thing I've ever heard.\"\n\nPancreas transplants are not recommended for most children with diabetes, but Kandaswamy said he hopes this case will open the way for children with rare conditions like Emmy who could benefit from a pancreas transplant. \"I think this will be an index case that will help spark that awareness,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking up to help others\n\nIn the family home in Columbia, South Carolina, Jack and Tiffanie Reeves are still in near disbelief at how well Emmy is doing. She's thriving in ways they could only dream of. Beyond her artwork, she's started playing the piano. She can go on hikes. She can shoot hoops. She can play with her younger sister, Abby.\n\nEmmy Reeves shows off the mural she painted in her sister's room after her transplant.\n\n\"She's getting a childhood, finally. She's getting to be able to be a kid,\" her mother said. \"I mean, this child's achieved so much in just the three months since transplant. It's going to be pretty incredible to get to see what she'll be able to do in the next few years.\"\n\nThe family agreed to tell Emmy's story in hopes that it can help other children suffering as she did. They know of four young children around the world with a similar insulin allergy as she.\n\n\"If our experience could help even one kid, I think it would be worth it,\" Tiffanie said.\n\nEmmy is not out of the woods. The first year after a transplant is especially critical. Her body could still reject the organ. The family tries not to dwell on that. \"We still live life, and we don't let the worry and stress of that keep us and our daughters from living the life that we need to,\" her father said.\n\nEmmy hopes to be a zoologist one day.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nFor now, she's shy around CNN's camera and doesn't want to talk with cameras rolling.

Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader was there to energize a strike of sanitation workers asking for better working conditions and higher pay. Ray was there to assassinate him.\n\nWhile King stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel (now a museum for peace), Ray accomplished his sinister goal with a single shot from more than 200 feet away.\n\nOver the next two months, while on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted Fugitives List, Ray was on the run, traveling to Europe on a false passport. He was eventually caught at London's Heathrow Airport. He pleaded guilty to avoid a jury trial and the death penalty, was sentenced to 99 years and sent to Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary in eastern Tennessee, surrounded by thick wooded hills.\n\nIn its day, it was considered one of the toughest state prisons, where inmates frequently killed each other. In the novel \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" Dr. Hannibal Lecter negotiates a transfer to the prison.\n\nBrushy was also nearly impossible to escape, but Ray managed it with the help of six other convicts in 1977. All were recaptured within days, though \"rescued\" is probably the better description. Cold, hunger and disorientation brought them to their knees, and their own fiction-worthy plot turned from \"The Great Escape\" to \"Blair Witch Project.\"\n\nRay himself traveled only 8 miles in a little over two days, a detail that made one local long-distance runner, Gary Cantrell, think to himself that he could make it 100 miles in that amount of time.\n\nAnd thus the seed of the Barkley Marathons was planted.\n\nMan vs. land\n\nCantrell, whose nickname is \"Lazarus Lake,\" or \"Laz\" as he is known by everyone, was further inspired to start his own race by this rugged land he knew so well. The name \"brushy\" is fitting for a rural area thick with undergrowth, briars and hidden obstacles that inflict cuts, bruises and falls. It's so dense, you can't see the top of any of the peaks from the bottom.\n\nThese mountains, where a day hike can be a challenge, are where truly competitive racing should be held, he thought, not on a flat, paved, well-marked course.\n\nThe Barkley consists of five loops of 20 miles each (though runners swear it's more like a marathon-length 26 miles). All told, it has about 67,000 feet of elevation -- from sea level to the peak of Mount Everest is 29,000 feet -- not that the other 67,000 feet of descent are much easier.\n\nPhotos: The world's hardest ultramarathon The Barkley Marathons consists of five loops, 20 miles each, along unmarked trails in rural Tennessee, with about 67,000 feet of elevation.

Runners must trace the course from a topographical map hours before the race begins. Most other distance races -- with their clear routes, aid stations, teams of helpful volunteers and throngs of encouraging spectators -- are designed so racers finish, but the Barkley is designed so racers fail.\n\nAnd fail they do. Of more than 1,000 who've entered, only 15 have completed the full distance in time. \"It's a good place for your ego to take a beating,\" Laz said before this year's race, sporting a red beanie labeled \"Geezer.\" His insightful quips are often followed by a cackle of delight, like the Yoda of the runner's world.\n\nAmong ultramarathoners, the Barkley is considered one of the hardest -- a superlative that is subjective, of course. There are footraces that cross deserts, traverse tall mountains and even go greater distances than Barkley's 100 or 130 or so miles. But it's the unique combination of impediments, punishing conditions and lack of assistance that makes this race the stuff of legend. It's even the subject of a documentary; a cameraman had to be rescued by rangers more than 12 hours after he got lost.\n\nIt's only in the face of such opposition that the highest peak physical and mental experiences are achieved. That's the idea, anyway. Among ultramarathoners and elite trail runners, the Barkley is the Holy Grail of races.\n\nHow it works (or doesn't)\n\nFor a competition that thumbs its nose at conventional rules, this anti-race race does have a number of parameters in which it operates (not written down, of course), all to maximize the challenge.

Other ultras charge hundreds of dollars, but Laz isn't in it for the money, though he's partial to a specific brand of dress sock.\n\nThousands apply every year, and only 40 are chosen. Just figuring out how to apply is a challenge: There's no website, email or physical address posted anywhere.\n\nLaz, as he is known by everyone, was inspired to create the Barkley Marathons by the local land and a prison escape by Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassin.\n\nWould-be runners write an essay on why they should be allowed to compete, and Laz chooses among these, factoring in their arguments or, in some cases, poetry but also their proven ability to endure. Finishers tend to have bona fides that include setting speed records on famous long-distance national trails or climbing the highest peaks in the world. If accepted, runners get a \"letter of condolence\" and told the date of the race (also a secret), and they must bring a license plate of some variety to the race site that are strung up in walls of metallic memory.\n\n'Good luck, morons'\n\nThis year's lucky (or maybe unlucky) runners -- 31 men, nine women -- gathered on a chilly April evening at a campground at Frozen Head State Park the day before the race. A single copy of the course map sat on a table as runners took turns tracing the route on their own topographical maps. The route changes in parts from year to year, and sometimes a peak is added. Veterans know to laminate them in clear tape to avoid disintegration from the elements.\n\nFour or five pages of Laz's enigmatic and wry instructions are also handed out. These mainly help runners find the checkpoint books, which often have tongue-in-cheek titles such as \"Where Do We Go From Here\" and \"A Time to Die.\" I asked one runner whether I could take a quick look at the instructions, and he seemed wary of handing over such well-kept secrets to a representative of a global media organization. One (non-identifiable) passage read, \"You will be able to make out the trail that climbs directly to pulloff, unless it is foggy, then you will have to guess.\"\n\nChicken and beans, cooked over an open fire, were served as part of a potluck the evening before the race started. There is little to no alcohol, as that's not conducive to running 100-plus miles. Runners greet each other warmly and exchange war stories of past Barkleys. It's a rarified club to which they belong. A cake read, \"Good luck, morons.\"\n\nBecause you don't know when the race is going to start, it makes for a fitful night's sleep, lest you miss the sound of the conch. This sleep-depriving FOMO was exacerbated by the cacophony of heavy rain pounding on the tents most of the night.\n\nMercifully, or just randomly, Laz gave everyone a full night of whatever sleep they could get, and the conch was blown at 8:30 a.m., under clear skies. When runners gathered an hour later to start, Laz gave few remarks, none particularly encouraging. After reading the names of Barkley veterans who died over the years, Laz removed his hat, and a bugler played taps, the traditional song of military funerals.\n\nTradition dictates that the start of the race is signaled by Laz lighting a Camel cigarette. Runners started trotting past him as he made his first exhale. The course begins with a steady incline that will reach 1,600 feet of elevation within just the first mile and a half or, as Laz described it, \"the easiest hill they'll do all day. After that, it turns ugly.\"\n\nAlthough he's done his fair share of endurance running (including a 318-mile course) and long-distance hiking (he's currently walking from Tennessee to Oregon), Laz has never competed in the Barkley himself. Neither has his friend Barry Barkley, for whom he named the race.\n\n'4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell'\n\nThe details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map.\n\nThe one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.\n\nThe race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing.\n\n\"This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog,\" Laz said, pausing for his punch line: \"at the same time.\" This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.\n\nBetween each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.\n\nNo one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.\n\nFinishing is so rare, there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated \"4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell.\"\n\nAndrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47\u00bd days. \"Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected,\" he wrote. \"All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.\"\n\nOnly one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. \"I am thrilled,\" he said after finishing in 2016, \"setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60.\" In 2014, he was more philosophical: \"There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life.\" And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: \"Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.\"\n\nIn 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: \"The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.\"\n\n'A different breed'\n\nTo reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual \"human sacrifice,\" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.\n\nBut if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.\n\nIn the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.\n\nUnlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: \"100% self-extraction\") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia.\n\nAlthough GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.\n\nTraining in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that \"snapped in two,\" Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. \"It's a different breed,\" he cackled.\n\nthough some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures. Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThat study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.\n\nAs for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A \"sense of accomplishment\" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line, it most certainly means going through hell to get there.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/26/health/barkley-marathons-sport-fit-nation/index.html", "published": "2018-05-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Burn survivor becomes beauty inspiration", "text": "Story highlights Shalom and her sister were badly burned in a kitchen accident when they were girls\n\nHer transformation videos about the power of makeup went viral\n\nShe is now a beauty and inspirational vlogger on YouTube and Instagram\n\n(CNN) With a drop of a pan, Shalom Blac's life changed forever.\n\n\"I remember just screaming and scraping my body, and my skin was literally falling on the floor,\" Blac said. \"I remember my mom telling me that I fainted.

Take her to the zoo. Walk her to school.\n\nShe's never been able to be the mother she longs to be.\n\nAt 38, Erika is dying.\n\nHer battle to live began almost as soon as her daughter, Lo\u00efe, was born four years ago, when Erika was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver.\n\nThe cancer was removed from her colon and, her doctors say, she responded well to treatment. But a microwave ablation surgery last year to remove two tumors from her liver went terribly wrong, leaving a fist-sized hole in her liver and destroying her bile ducts.\n\nEvery day since has been a fight to survive. She's been hospitalized 19 times in Oregon over the last 12 months for infections, bleeding and an array of other health issues.\n\nShe has high blood pressure in her liver, which backs up the veins in her esophagus and can be catastrophic. Her surgical oncologist constantly worries she will fall ill with a bad infection and die.\n\nWithout a liver transplant, her doctors say Erika will likely die before the end of the year.\n\n\"Every time she calls me and has a fever and some bleeding, we all hold our breath, worried: Will this be the time Erika bleeds to death?\" says Dr. Skye Mayo, her surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"This is kind of the end game of what liver failure looks like.\"\n\nMore than 100 doctors at three of the nation's top medical centers have weighed in on her case, which is complex and exceedingly rare. Their conclusion: The only way to save Erika's life is to give her a new liver.\n\nAfter weeks of evaluation at the Cleveland Clinic in December and January, Erika finally got her big break.\n\nOn February 2, doctors there approved putting her on the wait list for a liver transplant.\n\nThe news changed everything. Erika finally had hope. Around the house, 4-year-old Lo\u00efe would say, \"Mommy, when you get a new liver, can you push me in the swing?\"\n\nBut Erika hit an immediate wall. Her insurer, UnitedHealthcare, denied coverage for the transplant, saying it would not be a \"promising treatment.\" She appealed and was rejected again.\n\nThe mom who desperately wanted to live looked into Oregon's Death with Dignity program. Erika had written a letter to her daughter months ago to be read after she died. Now she worried Lo\u00efe might receive it sooner than Mom had planned:\n\nDear Lo\u00efe,\n\nIf you're reading this, I'm probably not on this earth anymore. So please remember this:\n\nI am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair. I am with you when you look up to the sky and see tiny birds flying free or the stars twinkling in your eyes. I am with you when you feel a perfect, warm breeze upon your sweet face.\n\nErika wasn't going to give up. Her little girl with bright blue eyes was a constant reminder of all that is precious.\n\nOutraged and heartbroken, Erika wrote a four-page letter to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare (UHC), giving him a piece of her mind about what she felt was a rigged review process, riddled with errors, that determined her life wasn't worth saving.\n\nWeeks passed until the company reached a decision. Despite her plea, the answer was the same: Denied.\n\nThen, last week, an amazing thing happened.\n\nErika Zak and her husband, Scott Powers, lock hands during a recent hospital visit. The two met 20 years ago.\n\n'My life hangs in the balance'\n\nIf it's true that opening your heart, revealing your feelings, unleashes freedom and makes you whole, Erika turned to one of the things she loves most in an effort to save her life. Writing.\n\nIt was early April. She sat at her computer, her keyboard clacking. She wasn't going to leave her husband, Scott Powers, and their daughter Lo\u00efe behind without trying her damnedest to stay on this Earth for as long as possible.\n\nThere was too much at stake.\n\nUnitedHealthcare had overruled her treating physicians and denied the transplant, saying \"unproven health services is not a covered benefit.\" The words burned, like chemo. Her first appeal went nowhere, and she felt trapped in a labyrinth of red tape.\n\nThe young mother -- frail from having lost 20 pounds in the past year, her skin and eyes yellow from jaundice -- felt the only way to get a new liver was to plead her case directly to the CEO of UnitedHealth Group, David Wichmann.\n\nHer frame may be tiny, but don't mistake that for weakness. She is one of the strongest women you will ever meet.\n\nAs she typed, Erika bared her soul. Of longing to live. Of seeing her daughter grow up. Of the need for \"my only option,\" a liver transplant.\n\n\"Given that my life hangs in the balance based on this review,\" she wrote, \"it is unconscionable that it has not been undertaken with the level of competence and professionalism anyone would expect of UHC.\"\n\nShe blasted what she called the \"shockingly incompetent manner\" in which the country's largest insurance company handled her case. She outlined what she described as a series of errors made in the review process -- ranging from UHC saying her liver failure stems from \"chemotherapy toxicity\" to an insurance medical director who erroneously said she had \"life-threatening lesions.\"\n\n\"Neither are true,\" she wrote Wichmann. \"(UHC's) handling of my case has been plagued by unnecessary delays, incomplete responses, inept scheduling, contradictory statements, and worst of all repeated factual errors regarding my medical history.\n\n\"Most importantly, decisions based on inaccurate information and analysis have already delayed my listing and transplant two months.\"\n\nLoie has been with her mother throughout the process. Erika calls her \"my tiniest, most amazing companion.\"\n\nOne review doctor noted she had a \"9cm tumor\" in her liver, she wrote, apparently unaware that was actually the hole from the ablation surgery resulting in her chronic liver failure.\n\n\"I have been doing every single thing I possibly can do to stay alive for these past four years, scratching and clawing by day and praying every night an opportunity like this would come along,\" Erika wrote. \"Now, when the promise of my long-term survival is actually greatest, I need UHC's support more than ever.\"\n\nShe sent the letter via FedEx on April 11.\n\nHer concerns were valid. Her transplant team at the Cleveland Clinic made clear to UHC's appeals unit the primary cause of her liver failure was not from chemo toxicity or cancer, but instead was the result of \"a consequence of complications following microwave ablation.\"\n\n\"Of note, what mainly drives the indication of liver transplantation in this case is liver failure and NOT liver metastases from colorectal cancer, which makes the patient's post-transplant oncologic outcome more encouraging,\" wrote Dr. Federico Aucejo, the director of the Cleveland Clinic's Liver Cancer Program, in an appeal on Erika's behalf on March 6. He did note that she had some chemotoxicity, which was a secondary cause of liver failure.\n\n\"The opinion of the experienced Cleveland Clinic multidisciplinary liver transplant committee (is) that liver transplantation would prolong this young patient's life substantially, and that there is NO other treatment alternative that could match this outcome at this point in time.\"\n\nTwo days after sending her letter, Erika and her husband were told the UHC executive team had received it and that her case was undergoing further review.\n\nSeveral times, the family said it was told a decision would be made by a certain date; those dates came and went without a decision.\n\nAs time wore on, Erika grew ill with a high fever and was hospitalized for several days. It was the fifth time she'd been admitted since February 2, the day Cleveland Clinic doctors approved her for a transplant.\n\nOn Instagram, she posted an illustration with the words \"waiting, waiting, waiting\" on a pink backdrop with black crosses.\n\n\"Waiting for insurance to approve the only thing that will save me: a liver,\" she wrote. \"Waiting for my liver to fail completely; waiting to die. Waiting to be saved.\"\n\nErika has undergone multiple surgeries and faced more than 70 rounds of chemotherapy.\n\n'Wait or die'\n\nMore than 100,000 Americans are on wait lists for organ transplants, and every hour someone dies while waiting for the life-saving surgery, said Dr. Andrew Cameron, the chief of transplant surgery at Johns Hopkins and the surgical director of its liver transplant program.\n\nFor liver transplants, 20,000 Americans are on the wait list and only 7,000 will receive a new liver in 2018, according to Cameron, who is not connected to Erika's case.\n\n\"The lucky few undergo a transformative life-saving procedure,\" he said. \"Those who don't get that lottery ticket wait or die.\"\n\nTransplant teams at hospitals spend hours upon hours -- months even -- assessing and debating whether a patient is a good candidate for a transplant, Cameron said, typically with more than a dozen doctors weighing in.\n\nIt is deeply disturbing, he said, when an insurance company overrules the \"decision made by a thoughtful, careful transplant team to utilize one of society's limited resources -- that precious gift to save somebody's life.\"\n\nThe negotiated cost for a liver transplant for an insurance company is roughly $200,000, Cameron said, adding it is \"exceedingly rare\" for an insurer to deny a transplant.\n\n\"That is highly unusual and highly undesirable,\" Cameron told CNN.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo is trailblazing the field for patients like Erika, having performed the only two transplants in America this century on people suffering from what is called unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer.\n\nIt's groundbreaking and could prove transformative.\n\n\"I hope that we can achieve good results and set precedent,\" he said.\n\nDr. Skye Mayo, a surgical oncologist at Oregon Health & Science University, has treated Erika Zak since 2015.\n\nWhen you're trying such a new approach, Dr. Aucejo said, it can be difficult getting insurers to agree to treatment and he wished getting them aboard could be done \"in a more expeditious way.\"\n\nHe explained that in the late 1980s and 1990s, surgeons tried transplants on patients like Erika with \"unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer,\" but the \"outcomes were not good.\"\n\nOnly 18% of the patients lived past five years, so the transplants were stopped, Dr. Aucejo said. But, he emphasized, most of the bad outcomes were the result of technical complications and post-transplant management, not from the cancer returning. The field of transplants has greatly improved in the decades since, he said.\n\nDoctors in Europe, primarily in Norway, have begun changing the field, he said, finding that about 50-60% of patients with Erika's condition survive a transplant past five years.\n\nThat is a substantial difference, he said.\n\nDr. Mayo, Erika's surgical oncologist in Oregon, said no one at the insurance company reached out to him during the review process \"to help explain the facts of her case.\"\n\nThat is troubling, he said, especially when it's one of the most complicated cases a doctor will ever see.\n\n\"It is frustrating when it seems that the facts aren't all being considered,\" Dr. Mayo said.\n\n\"Her life now is not limited by her cancer,\" he said. \"It's limited by the fact she will go into liver failure and die within the next several months if she doesn't have a liver transplant.\"\n\nErika wrote a note for her daughter if she does not survive: \"I am with you always; even if you can no longer see my face or feel my hands through your hair.\"\n\nWhen opposites attract\n\nErika was in the prime of her life. At 34, she'd given birth to her first and only child, Lo\u00efe, the little girl who Mom calls \"my tiniest, most amazing companion.\"\n\nShe'd been married to the love of her life for four years. She and Scott met in 1998 when he was at Brown University and she was at the Rhode Island School of Design, both in Providence.\n\nThe two were polar opposites. He was the MVP of Brown's soccer team and majored in economics. She was into the arts and majored in textile design. He was from the tightly wound East Coast, she from the free-wheeling West Coast.\n\nThe connection wasn't immediate, so Erika had a mutual friend slip a tiny drawing to Scott. It contained her phone number; he called it.\n\nSoon they clicked. Scott made her laugh and feel beautiful. Erika saw in him someone who was kind and devoted; in her, he found the woman who he'd always searched for, with a captivating sense of humor and a sailor's mouth.\n\nThey tied the knot on Halloween in 2009 in the wine country of Healdsburg, California.\n\nHer career was taking off, too. She was working for Old Navy, choosing and designing the fabrics, prints and plaids for the company's baby and toddler division. While she was pregnant, she was promoted to senior textile designer.\n\n\"It was all coming together,\" she wrote on her blog. \"And then, like that, my foundation crumbled.\"\n\nDuring the final trimester of her pregnancy, she'd experienced pain in her stomach. It was thought to be nothing more than part of the difficulties of pregnancy. But in the weeks after delivery, the pain grew excruciating and she felt a lump on her side.\n\nOn April 8, 2014, she received the awful news -- that she had stage 4 metastatic colon cancer that had spread to her liver. Her daughter was just 3 months old.\n\n\"Worst Day Ever\" read the headline of her blog.\n\nShe had survived cancer once before. At 28, she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Her thyroid was removed, and life continued as normal. It was nothing close to a stage 4 diagnosis.\n\nIn the years after her colon cancer diagnosis, she blogged about most everything. Of losing her father to Alzheimer's at age 83. Of the pain over two friends' deaths -- including an oncologist she'd met in a cancer support group.\n\n\"Have you ever cried and screamed so hard that the blood vessels around your eyes burst?\" she wrote.\n\nIn her blog posts, she was brutally honest about her cancer and the effects of chemotherapy.\n\nErika and Scott Powers met in college while they were both in school in Rhode Island.\n\nShe'd sit on the shower floor in a fetal position, screaming and sobbing. It was \"anguish and pain and longing for my former life and utter disbelief for the war my body was waging on itself,\" she blogged.\n\nHer fingertips felt like they had been \"burned on a hot pan most of the time.\" Her hands cramped into weird, contorted positions. Her hair was dry and brittle, like straw. Her energy was so drained she felt twice her age.\n\nAs a teen, she'd suffered debilitating depression and anxiety that was so bad at times, she said, \"I hoped that I could just disappear forever.\"\n\n\"It's funny how afraid I am of that now: disappearing. How much I want to live. How important it feels to be here,\" she wrote on December 1, 2016, two and half years into her cancer battle.\n\nShe would face multiple surgeries and undergo more than 70 rounds of chemo. On February 28, 2017, she wrote:\n\n\"This is chemo day. Scream in your pillow day. Hide in the shower day. Lie to your baby day. Tell her you're going to work day. Vials and vials of blood day. Tell your doctor you're angry day. Make your husband cry day. Poison your body day.\"\n\nOn another day, she penned: \"Cancer is a slow form of torture. It strips you of dignity; of peace of mind; of stability.\"\n\nOn April 4, 2017, nearly three years to the day of her diagnosis, she and her daughter had a soul-crushing conversation. The cancer had been eradicated from her colon shortly after the diagnosis, but it remained in her liver.\n\n\"Mommy, are you going to last?\" Lo\u00efe asked.\n\n\"What do you mean, Lo\u00efe?\"\n\n\"Will you be here forever and ever?\" the girl asked.\n\n\"I really don't know, babe.\"\n\nAs she awaited word from her insurer about the transplant, Erika said, \"I'm mad and grouchy, but I still feel like I have a fighting chance.\"\n\nSix days later, Erika underwent the ablation surgery at a facility in New York to target two small tumors on her liver. Something went wrong. She ended up with the hole in her liver.\n\nTo save her life, surgeons had to block off the veins and arteries going to her liver. The entire central part of her liver died, Dr. Mayo said. Two bags are now attached to her abdomen to drain the bile.\n\nWith bile going immediately outside her body, instead of through the liver and her body, Erika was susceptible to extreme sickness and potential fatal bleeds.\n\n\"All of those things culminated in what is now liver failure for her,\" Dr. Mayo said. \"She's in this cycle right now where she's losing on a daily basis some of her body's most vital fluids.\"\n\nThe cancer in her liver, meanwhile, was progressing on a path, he said, where \"she would die of cancer.\" She could no longer tolerate any standard form of chemo treatment.\n\nHer doctors in Oregon last fall tried one last treatment to fend off her cancer: a groundbreaking immunotherapy cancer drug called pembrolizumab, known by its brand name Keytruda.\n\nHer sky-high tumor marker levels fell to normal. \"She had an incredible response to this new drug,\" Dr. Mayo said. \"I think all of the cancer remaining in her body is dead at this point. What she will die of is liver failure.\"\n\nWith a new liver, he said, her problems with bleeding and high blood pressure could be resolved. Her jaundice would be gone, too.\n\nBut transplant surgery is not without major risks.\n\nMost of those who've received a transplant with unresectable metastasis in the liver from colorectal cancer, Cleveland's Dr. Aucejo said, experience a recurrence of cancer within 12 months.\n\nMost of the cancers that return can be treated with standard care, like chemotherapy or surgery, he said, profoundly prolonging their lives.\n\nFor a small subset of patients, though, the cancer comes back aggressively and it's not treatable with chemo or surgery, he said. \"Unfortunately in that subset of patients, the survival is more dismal.\"\n\nWhile it's impossible to predict the outcome, he said, Erika shows \"features that may do well.\" There's no evidence cancer has spread beyond her liver, he said.\n\nPlus, patients who had their colon cancer removed two years or more before the transplant, Dr. Aucejo said, tend do well. Erika had the cancerous portion of her colon removed in 2014: \"That's a good indicator.\"\n\nDr. Aucejo also emphasized the criteria for transplant qualification is stringent and that Erika shows promise.\n\n\"We're talking about distributing limited organs,\" he said. \"Again, we have to be very careful that we're not giving organs to people who are not going to benefit from it when there's people dying with standard indications because there's not enough organs.\"\n\nErika Zak comes to the hospital every three weeks for a groundbreaking immunotherapy drug. Her doctors says that without it, she would have died of cancer.\n\n'This is so messed up'\n\nIn the days and weeks after Erika fired off her letter to the CEO, her husband, Scott, worked the phones.\n\nHe felt lost in an endless loop of delays and broken promises as to when the insurer would reach its decision.\n\nFinally, they were told a decision would come May 2.\n\nErika couldn't sleep the night before. She pulled out her phone and recorded a message, weeping for much of the video.\n\n\"My life is literally in their hands, and every day I feel myself kind of fading away more and more,\" she says. \"I don't want to leave. I don't want to die.\"\n\nThe next day came. Each minute crept by.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m., Scott's phone rang.\n\nIt was their point of contact with UnitedHealthcare.\n\nHe had crushing news: Denied.\n\nHe explained Erika's case was sent back to the three reviewing doctors. One of them, he said, \"changed his decision from 'not promising' to 'promising.'\"\n\nHowever, the other two doctors ruled the transplant not to be promising: \"The bottom line is they're upholding that decision.\"\n\nThe doctor who sided in favor of the transplant, their UHC contact told them, was the only one of the three who talked directly with her transplant surgeon.\n\nScott grew furious. \"Honestly, you know that is messed up,\" he said. \"I don't know who you've got to go to, but I would go to someone now and have someone call us, because this is so messed up.\"\n\nScott Powers has advocated for his wife since she was first diagnosed with cancer.\n\nScott pressed for more information. He got little.\n\n\"Scott, I know what you've been through,\" the UHC rep told him. \"I know what you're going through.\"\n\nErika sat silently for the first 10 minutes of the conservation, absorbing the news and what it meant for her fate. But at those words, it was time to speak up.\n\n\"Hey!\" she shouted. \"This is Erika, and you've never heard from me before. You don't know what we're going through. Because I'm dying.\"\n\nThrough tears, she said, \"I need a liver transplant, and I need it now.\"\n\nThe UHC rep confided he \"was not hoping for this outcome. I was hoping that I'd have good news.\"\n\nHe suggested Erika and Scott fax over any new information they thought might be relevant. He also acknowledged the delays in recent weeks were not in keeping with the company's policies.\n\n\"Someone needs to be accountable for this,\" he said. \"You know, why, when we have these guidelines in place, did we not follow them?\n\n\"That needs to be looked into,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not trying to sweep anything under the rug.\"\n\nHe apologized for having to be the bearer of bad news, saying his goal had been to end the day on a positive note.\n\n\"Like I said, I wish I had better news.\"\n\nAfter more than 30 minutes, he ended with: \"Have a good night, OK.\"\n\nNot the words the couple wanted to hear.\n\nErika went numb. Heartbroken and angry didn't even begin to describe her feelings.\n\nScott felt equally distraught. \"I just want her to get a liver,\" he said. \"She deserves that.\"\n\nThe CEO never responded -- not by email, phone or letter.\n\nErika Zak says her will to live is motivated by her daughter, Lo\u00efe. Here, they play on the couch as the family dog, Maddie, watches.\n\nA sudden change\n\nFive days later, on Monday, May 7, a surprise call came. Erika and Scott were preparing Lo\u00efe for school when Scott's phone rang.\n\nThey had spent the weekend trying to figure out their next move, while trying not to focus too much on when Erika might need Death with Dignity. They knew they had one appeal left, and they didn't want to blow it.\n\nThey hadn't sent any new information since the last call.\n\nIt was their UHC rep on the phone. This time, he had good news: The insurer would cover Erika's transplant.\n\nWhen Scott heard she'd been approved, he jumped up and down. Erika watched him from across the room.\n\nThere was no explanation for the change. They were told to focus on Erika's health and next steps.\n\nErika called her mother, who unleashed a guttural scream at work.\n\nLo\u00efe has grown excited at the prospect of her mother's transplant. Erika just wants to be able to walk her to school or take her to the playground.\n\nDr. Mayo was preparing for surgery when he took Scott's call. Elation spread across the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University where doctors, nurses and staff celebrated.\n\nIn Cleveland, Dr. Aucejo heard the welcome news from his transplant coordinator. He'd not spoken with anyone at UHC about the case in the five days since the previous denial.\n\n\"They had decided on their own. We hadn't gotten back to them,\" he said. \"I'm happy they ended up sharing our vision.\"\n\nI had been speaking with Erika and Scott for this story over the last month and had reviewed her medical records extensively. During the May 2 phone call in which Erika was told her transplant had been denied, Scott told the UHC rep that the couple had been speaking with a member of the national news media.\n\nI was on a flight to Oregon when they received the joyous news. \"UHC just called and approved Erika. Unreal. Know you're in flight but call whenever,\" Scott texted.\n\nWhen we met a couple hours later, Erika's emotions were still raw. She thought this would be her last Mother's Day. Now, suddenly, she has hope for more.\n\nGlancing at her daughter and husband, Erika broke down in tears.\n\n\"I can't imagine not being here,\" she said. \"It's not because I keep the family together or anything. It's just the love I have for them.\"\n\n\"Mommy, why are you crying?\" Lo\u00efe said.\n\n\"I'm crying because I love you.\"\n\nLo\u00efe placed her fingers in her mother's right hand.\n\n\"Love you,\" Lo\u00efe said.\n\nAs she and Lo\u00efe locked hands, the tattoo on Erika's wrist displayed a fitting message: \"Be brave.\"\n\nDuring her cancer fight, Erika and her twin sister got matching tatoos with one message: \"Be brave.\"\n\nEpilogue\n\nUnitedHealthcare declined to answer CNN's questions about the handling of Erika's case, except to issue this one-sentence statement:\n\n\"We had on-going conversations with her husband and contacted him as soon as the decision was made to approve the transplant request.\"\n\nEven after the approval, Erika said she still wanted to move forward with the story, to speak up for others who've experienced the pain of similar denials. To let them know they're not alone. To encourage them to be their own best advocates.\n\nIt can mean the difference between life and death.\n\n\"No one should have to fight and work that hard,\" she said, \"especially when I have all these doctors saying it will save my life.\"\n\nSince the approval, the family has been preparing to move to Cleveland for Erika's surgery and recovery at the Cleveland Clinic. Erika was officially notified Friday morning she was placed on the liver transplant wait list.\n\nIt's impossible to know how long the family will be in Cleveland or when the transplant will occur. Transplant candidates are given what is known as a \"MELD score,\" ranging from 6 to 40. Those closest to 40 are given the highest priority.\n\nErika's MELD score has hovered around 22. If her score is still in that range, Dr. Aucejo said, her transplant could be a few months away.\n\n\"But this varies a lot,\" he said. \"There are many variables at play here.\"\n\nA patient for a liver transplant, he said, is typically hospitalized 7 to 10 days for the procedure, with a recovery time of 4 to 8 weeks before the patient resumes normal activities.\n\nWould Erika have had the transplant by now if the surgery had been approved in February?\n\nEvery day Erika says she can feel her body deteriorating. \"I don't want to die,\" she says.\n\n\"That is very speculative, at the least,\" Dr. Aucejo said. \"I couldn't say that.\"\n\nHe chose his words carefully, saying it's a \"complex dynamic\" between hospitals and insurance companies and he doesn't want to upset that balance.\n\n\"She's been approved and that's what matters -- and hopefully we can move forward with her transplant.\"\n\nDr. Aucejo said he can somewhat understand the insurance company's initial reluctance at coverage because the procedure is so rare for patients with Erika's condition.\n\n\"It's a new territory,\" he told CNN. \"I can't blame anybody.\"\n\nIf Erika receives her transplant and succeeds, Dr. Aucejo said, she could help set precedent for many others down the road.\n\nMore than anything, she would finally get a chance to be the mother she wants to be.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/13/health/liver-transplant-mom-erika-zak/index.html", "published": "2018-05-13T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why a terminally ill young woman changed her mind about living", "text": "La Jolla, California (CNN) To face each day, Claire Wineland undergoes hours of breathing treatments. It's a reality of living with cystic fibrosis she's come to accept.\n\nBut last month, as the nebulizer hummed loudly in her La Jolla, California, hotel room, she breathed in medicine through her mask and hoped this day would be the first step toward something different.\n\nShe'd traveled from Los Angeles with her mother, her best friend and her pit bull, Daisy, who flopped down on the floor atop one of Claire's ever-present oxygen tubes. A full day of appointments at a nearby medical center awaited her, when she would begin the evaluation process to see whether she might be a candidate for a double-lung transplant.\n\nA year earlier, Claire vowed that she'd never have the major surgery.\n\n\"It's not for me and never has been,\" she said at the time.\n\nShe was more comfortable dealing with the illness she knew than taking on the unknown. She preferred to focus on leading a purposeful life than worrying about death and how to dodge it.\n\nClaire Wineland sits in her hotel room with dog Daisy before heading to evaluations at the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health.\n\nA series of irreversible setbacks and some painful soul-searching, however, have prompted an about-face in her thinking. Claire, 21, needs new lungs, or she will die -- sooner than she's willing to accept.\n\nThe only question is: Did her change of heart come too late?\n\nFeeling trapped\n\nIt wasn't as if the clouds parted and she suddenly saw the light. Claire's new outlook was the result of a messy and humbling self-reckoning.\n\nShe had long managed to push through physical discomfort to lead a life that mattered. After emerging from a 16-day medically induced coma at age 13, she envisioned the Claire's Place Foundation , which today provides financial support to struggling families affected by cystic fibrosis. She appeared in brutally honest viral videos in which she talked about topics like death and did it with a smile. Since she was 14, she had been taking to stages and wowing audiences with beyond-her-years wisdom. Along the way, she nurtured a love of travel.\n\nShe was wrapping up a three-city tour last fall when pneumonia landed her in a Philadelphia hospital for two weeks.\n\nDoctors there sat her down and told Claire she had to stop flying. Period. They told her that her lungs could collapse and that she ran the risk of dropping dead on a plane, she said. They warned that it would be painful and laid out what it would feel like if an air pocket in her lungs burst.\n\n\"You will feel like you're being stabbed to death ... and then blood will stop flowing to your brain,\" she remembered them saying. \"And I was like, 'OK, I got the message! Copy that!' \"\n\nShe took a three-day train ride home and began to settle down.\n\nBecause her body works so hard to breathe, Claire must take in about 5,000 calories a day and relies on a feeding tube to absorb calories while she sleeps.\n\nCystic fibrosis affects more than 30,000 people in the United States (and more than 70,000 worldwide), according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation . The disease causes an overabundance of mucus, which traps infections and blocks airways in the lungs, complicates digestion, affects the pancreas and other organs and, eventually, leads to respiratory failure.\n\nThe median survival age is about 40, according to the foundation -- a great improvement from the 1950s, when surviving long enough to attend elementary school was rare.\n\nClaire became uber-diligent with her care. She was on top of her dozens of medications, including her shots for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes, endured as best she could the feeding tube at night, even though it made her throw up, and spent extra time with her breathing treatments. For four hours daily, she said, she wore a vest to shake her lungs and loosen mucus. She also tried supplements like turmeric and found comfort in the nettle infusions she drank throughout the day.\n\nBut even with all of this, her lung function continued to decline. In one year, she said her working lung capacity fell 10 points -- from 35% to 25%. Short walks and visits to the beach left this lover of the outdoors exhausted. Simple grocery shopping became too tough to manage. She had no energy for local speaking engagements and lost her income flow. She felt homebound, trapped and unable to do what mattered to her most.\n\nCFers, as she refers to people with cystic fibrosis, often talk about \"the Wheelchair Decision\" with dread, Claire said. But when breathing and getting around became too difficult and she got hers in February, it initially felt \"like freedom.\"\n\nWith her best friend, Larissa, taking on the role of \"designated wheeler,\" the duo could tool around outside. The day she got the wheelchair, they went on a seven-hour adventure around Los Angeles' Venice Beach, where Claire lives, visiting the canals, going to the park, soaking in the ocean breeze.\n\nAnd while most of the time, she has no qualms about needing a wheelchair, there are accessibility issues, the sidewalks are a mess, and she can't be pushed through sand. Inevitably, she's had those moments when she thinks, \"It sucks that I need this. It's painful that it's gotten this far.\"\n\nClaire breathes in medicine through a nebulizer as Larissa pounds her back with cupped hands to help loosen mucus in her airways.\n\nThen Claire, who's undergone more than 30 surgeries and been in the hospital a quarter of her life, received another jolt during a March hospital stay. Medical staff discovered that her portacath wasn't working. The small dome under the skin of her chest provides a central line into a vein, allowing easy administration of IV treatments -- such as antibiotics, which she must take regularly to beat back constant infections. A portacath replacement means surgery, and Claire's pulmonary function was -- and remains -- at a level too dangerous for her to go under anesthesia.\n\nThough the portacath was fixable, Claire didn't know it would be at the time. A wave of terror washed over her. She fell apart and realized it was time to take the transplant idea seriously.\n\n\"I can't go under anesthesia. I can't fly. I can't do anything,\" she remembered feeling with a panic. \"I have completely locked myself in a position of not being able to do anything besides die.\"\n\nReady for the race\n\nAfter leaving the La Jolla hotel, Claire was wheeled into the Center for Transplantation at UC San Diego Health, prepared to meet with members of the lung transplant team.\n\nShe'd eaten a McDonald's McGriddle sandwich the day before -- a secret she employs to put on an extra pound or two before weigh-ins -- just in case they asked her and her 95-pound frame to step on a scale. She was armed with questions and a notepad, ready to studiously record all she'd learn. Since she'd been here less than two years earlier and decided against pursuing the transplant path then, she was eager to tell them why this time was different.\n\nA nurse who serves as the lung transplant coordinator, Megan Serletti, spent several hours educating Claire, her mom and Larissa about the process.\n\nMegan Serletti, top, a nurse who works as a lung transplant coordinator, leads Claire and her mom, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, into the transplantation center.\n\nThey talked about the battery of tests that would determine whether she would qualify to get on the waiting list, some of which Claire knew well and described as \"gnarly.\" They discussed the lung allocation score, the number Claire will get if she's approved that measures how sick she is and determines where she sits on the priority list.\n\nThey discussed what life on a waitlist looks like: the necessity that she stay within a four-hour drive of the center, the importance of not ignoring phone calls, the exercise she'd need to grow stronger and the multitude of blood draws and exams she'd have on her schedule.\n\n\"We call a transplant your marathon,\" Serletti said. \"We tell people to train for your marathon. The day you get called is the day of the race.\"\n\nThere were forms to sign and questions she'd need to consider. For example, would she be willing to accept lungs from a prostitute?\n\n\"I'm fine if a donor had sex in exchange for money,\" Claire quipped. \"Way to bring the hustle.\"\n\nHow about from someone who was an IV drug user and contracted hepatitis C, a condition that is treatable?\n\n\"Honestly, I'd just laugh if I got new lungs and caught something else,\" she said. \"I already have the body of someone who's been around the block.\"\n\nSerletti spoke of the realities after surgery, including the drugs Claire would need to take for the rest of her life, the physical and emotional challenges she might face, the changes in lifestyle she'd have to honor.\n\nClaire wrote everything down. She curled her legs into the chair, revealing the tattoo on her left ankle: the thumbs-up \"Don't Panic\" logo from \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\"\n\n\"None of it spooked me,\" Claire said afterward, over lunch in the transplantation center's courtyard. \"Now that I'm looking at it as something I have to do, I don't care about any of the side effects. I'm willing to deal with anything.\"\n\n'We both just started crying'\n\nTo qualify for new lungs, a person must be sick enough to need a transplant yet strong enough to withstand the surgery and recovery.\n\nThere were 1,436 candidates for lung transplants as of April 20, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing , which manages the nation's organ waiting lists. Of those, 122 had a primary diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Last year, of the total 2,449 lung transplants performed, CFers accounted for nearly 11% of the recipients.\n\nUnlike previous introductory meetings, when her heart wasn't in it, Claire takes in every word during this education session about lung transplants.\n\nA lung transplant is not a cure, but it can extend a life, if all goes well.\n\nOf those who received lung transplants (not just CFers), dating to 2000, an average of 84% survived after one year, nearly 54% survived five years, and slightly more than 30% survived 10 years or more, according to the organ sharing network's data.\n\nDeciding to go for a lung transplant, let alone a double-lung transplant (the only option for CFers), is no small matter.\n\nClaire first visited a transplantation center at UCLA when she was 14 but said that was too early for the idea to make sense for her. At 17, she checked out the program at Stanford University but was turned down, her mom explained, because they could tell that Claire wasn't interested. She checked out the option again, at the very place she had returned to now, when she was 19.\n\nWhile her peers were being tasked with picking out prom dresses or decorating dorm rooms, she was being asked to contemplate her mortality.\n\nShe prayed that she'd want it as much as she knew her parents and doctors did, but her heart wasn't in it, she said. She was still happy with what she had and, as an adult, able to make her own decisions.\n\nHer parents, who split up when Claire was 3, struggled to make peace with her choice.\n\n\"Just think of it as insurance, even if you don't want to do it,\" her mother, Melissa Nordquist Yeager, pleaded at first. \"Get on the list so you can change your mind.\"\n\nBut ever since she'd been a small child, Claire had a sense of self, an understanding of her condition and a sort of intuition Yeager needed to trust -- even if it made her uncomfortable.\n\nHer dad, John Wineland, said Claire \"has a relationship with her body that is sacred\" and described his daughter's thinking: \"This is the body I came in with. This is the body I'm going out with.\"\n\nAnd as her parent, he said, \"I have to live with it.\"\n\nClaire was born with cystic fibrosis and has spent a quarter of her life in the hospital. (Family Photo)\n\nTo see her struggle and deteriorate over the past year was both sobering and excruciating for them. So when Claire broke down and said she'd changed her mind, they were thrilled, excited and terrified.\n\n\"I was blown away, so grateful, happy and hopeful. It was a sign that she wasn't willing to give up,\" remembered Yeager, who was with Claire at the hospital in March and heard the news first.\n\n\"I called her dad, and we both just started crying,\" Yeager said.\n\n\"I'm just praying my ass off, really, that everything goes smoothly, that she can get a shot at more time on the planet,\" Claire's dad said. \"There are a lot of hoops she has to jump through to be accepted.\"\n\n'Are you ready?'\n\nIt's not uncommon for CFers to change their minds about transplant, social worker Leslie Fijolek assured Claire.\n\nFijolek, who serves on the transplant team, remembered Claire from the last time she visited UC San Diego Health. Fijolek's job is to think about \"who are these [new] lungs going to live with,\" she said, get a sense of the care system recipients have in place and provide support to make the process successful for everyone involved.\n\nIs Claire compliant in taking her medications? Is she prepared to relocate near the transplantation center, where she'll need to be for at least three months after the transplant if she gets one? Who'd move with her and drive her to appointments?\n\n\"How's your mood been? Any depression and anxiety?\" Fijolek asked.\n\nLeslie Fijolek, a social worker, asks Claire hard questions to see whether she's prepared to take on what a transplant would mean.\n\nClaire mentioned how her decline, starting last fall, threw her into a depression. They talked about how she'd lost the ability to manage her physical decline, how she'd like to find a therapist who works with patients facing chronic illness, how she turns to arts and crafts projects to get out of bed -- and out of her head -- on rough days.\n\nPhotos on a cell phone are passed around, showing the papier-mache tree she's been working on and how the bark and surrounding foliage are remarkably true to life.\n\nFijolek turned serious, locked eyes with Claire and said what everyone in the room already understood: \"You know you need a transplant.\"\n\n\"I was so young. I was so na\u00efve,\" Claire answered, describing where she was before. \"All the side effects used to scare the shit out of me. My relationship to transplant and all it entails has changed.\"\n\nFijolek, who was all too familiar with Claire's past ambivalence, pushed her further.\n\n\"Let's say you got listed in about two weeks; it means you can get a call at any time,\" she said. \"Are you ready?\"\n\nClaire assured her she is.\n\n\"It's a big change from where you were,\" the social worker said.\n\n\"I didn't want to waste anyone's time,\" Claire answered.\n\nHer mother sat by, fanning herself with a medical brochure, listened and wiped a tear from her eye.\n\nAll she had\n\nThe last appointment of the day was with one of the transplant team's pulmonologists.\n\nDr. Kamyar Afshar explains the importance of Claire building her strength so she can handle the transplant, if she's given one.\n\nDr. Kamyar Afshar got down to the nitty gritty. He wanted to know what antibiotics still worked for her, how many bowel movements she has a day and the last time she coughed up blood.\n\n\"Two days ago,\" she told him. \"It's usually one or two times a month.\"\n\nHe prescribed walks every day to build up her endurance and suggested she increase her continuous oxygen flow from her normal 2 liters per minute to 6 liters per minute when exercising. He looked down at her worn Birkenstocks and said, \"Your shoes will have to change.\"\n\nThe doctor cranked up her oxygen and told her that if she wanted to get a transplant, she'd need to be able to do 15 sits-to-stands in a minute. He said this was non-negotiable. She won't be able to use her arms after the surgery to get up from a chair or bed, he explained.\n\nHe asked her to climb off the exam table and show him some squats.\n\nClaire -- who used to do yoga six days a week, loved to swim and even went through a phase when she did difficult workout videos like P90X with her dad -- crossed her arms in front of her chest and showed the doctor all she had.\n\nFor the first time that day, her cheeks had color.\n\n\"I don't anticipate you'd be on the list for too long,\" Afshar blurted out.\n\nGiven her blood type and her condition, he said, she'd probably get a transplant within three months of being approved -- if she's approved.\n\nThe first full day of evaluation appoitnments complete, Claire and her mom breathe sighs of overwhelmed relief.\n\nClaire's eyes opened wide, and her mom appeared to melt into her chair. Suddenly, it seemed real.\n\n\"Three months!\" Yeager said outside the center. \"That made me want to throw up a little bit.\"\n\n\"I'm a little overwhelmed,\" Claire said. \"I need to go back to the hotel and binge-watch 'Real Housewives.' I want to see white women fight over nothingness.\"\n\nHoping for a chance\n\nThe truth is, according to Claire, not longing for different lungs for most of her life served her well.\n\nShe was able to \"work with what I had in front of me,\" she said, rather than fixate on what she didn't have. She also suppressed that part of herself that might have simply dreamed of something more.\n\n\"If I had told myself things could be better than they are now, I think I would have driven myself crazy with frustration and jealousy over other people's lives,\" she said.\n\nIn changing her mind, she said she had to swallow some of her pride and \"open this floodgate of emotion that I kept really deeply buried.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA slew of tests still awaited Claire, but she was now all in. She had opened herself up to the possibility that life -- for her -- could be different and not as challenging.\n\n\"For the first time ever, I'm going there, and it's really scary,\" she said. \"Now that I actually want something better, what if it doesn't happen? What if I don't get it? What if it goes wrong?\"\n\nThe pressure is on, and Claire can only hope that she will be given her chance.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/23/health/claire-wineland-transplant-evaluation/index.html", "published": "2018-05-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The new frontier of gene doping will modify athlete DNA", "text": "For a busy physiologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, that may be expected, but the reason behind the calls wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill.\n\nThe people on the other end of the line were athletes in search of a particular kind of fix: They wanted him to dope them -- via their genes.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Sweeney made headlines because of his research on \"Schwarzenegger mice,\" which were up to 30% stronger than their average counterparts. Sweeney had been able to isolate the gene responsible for activating a protein -- IGF-1 -- that controls muscle growth and repair.\n\nThe main focus of his experiments was on how to limit the deterioration of muscles with age, but the results also appealed to athletes in search of a performance boost.\n\nWord got out, however, that he was not interested.\n\nAhead of this year's Commonwealth Games, which started April 4, Sweeney's was not such a hot number for athletes in search of an unfair advantage -- possibly because he is now an adviser for the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\n\"At the beginning, when we first started publishing on this, we did get contacted by high-level athletes,\" said Sweeney, who's also director of the University of Florida's Myology Institute. \"These days, it's mostly body builders and people desperate to increase their performance or abilities.\"\n\nBack then, gene therapy -- defined as the technique of using and manipulating genes in order to treat or prevent diseases -- wasn't as established as it is today and wasn't recognised as enough of a threat to be listed as a banned practice in sport. But it soon became known that gene therapies could one day be used for much more than disease.\n\nResponding promptly to the possibility, in 2002, the anti-doping agency established \"gene and cell-doping panels\" of expert scientists to discuss how best to head off the problem.\n\nIn 2003, the organization banned \"gene doping,\" which it defined as the \"nontherapeutic use of cells, genes, genetic elements, or modulation of gene expression, having the capacity to enhance performance.\"\n\nThis new frontier of doping presented a simple and dark idea: What if there was a way for dopers to never be caught?\n\nNow, almost 20 years later, the technology is has finally been used to treat patients with rare diseases -- such as severe combined immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disorder, hemophilia, blindness, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases -- by transferring missing genes into skeletal muscles, Sweeney said. \"So because of that, it is now at a point where potentially it could be used by athletes.\n\n\"It could be done today in athletes if some company and government would put the resources (in) to make it happen,\" he said.\n\nGetting inside your genes\n\nIn the case of the \"Schwarzenegger mice,\" Sweeney used the classic method of gene therapy, in which he modified the animals' DNA using a virus to deliver and insert the required gene that would make the mice stronger.\n\nGenes are delivered into an organism using a \"vector,\" the most common being viruses, like that used by Sweeney, which have been modified to be safe and no longer cause disease. The vectors carry the desired gene into targeted cells and, there, unload the genetic material, which in turn instructs the organism to produce the protein the gene encodes.\n\nOne example of a protein well-known to athletes is erythropoietin, commonly known as EPO, which regulates the production of red blood cells in the body, increasing hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to tissues.\n\nWith the injection of external EPO, elite athletes -- often cyclists -- have been enhancing performance for years, but authorities have caught on. Anti-doping controls can now detect external EPO efficiently through blood and urine tests.\n\nA doping urine test kit is seen on February 25, 2015 in Chatenay, France.\n\nIf extra EPO is being produced organically by a cell's machinery, however, it is almost impossible to detect as a banned substance.\n\nBut the technology is not quite at that level yet.\n\n\"Making the viruses that are involved in doing the gene transfer is still difficult,\" Sweeney said, highlighting that the science is still complicated and not something athletes could readily do at home.\n\nAnother way to dope an athlete's genes is through CRISPR, or CRISPR-Cas9, a technique that allows geneticists to edit specific parts of a person's genome by removing or altering sections of DNA -- also known as gene editing.\n\nThe technique is rapidly developing, leading to a World Anti-Doping Agency announcement in October that it was expanding its \"gene-doping\" ban to \"gene editing agents designed to alter genome sequences and/or the transcriptional or epigenetic regulation of gene expression.\"\n\nThe ban went into effect in January.\n\n\"There's a couple of ways you can use CRISPR-Cas9,\" Sweeney said. \"One is to take cells from a person, modify those cells and put them back into the person, and that is probably the safest way to use it.\n\n\"The other way to use it, which is to modify your existent DNA in the body, is potentially very unsafe.\"\n\nFalse kit of genetics editing with Crispr Cas-9 technology.\n\nSweeney pointed out that scientists do not know what unintended consequences could come from changing a specific gene in an individual, meaning the technology is not even ready for trials in patients with lethal diseases.\n\nIn the case of gene-doping through gene therapies, using vectors for delivery, it's relatively easy to look for an extra copy of a gene and confirm that an athlete has been doped when you have access to a biological sample, such as blood, said Olivier Rabin, senior executive director of sciences and international partnerships at the anti-doping agency.\n\nIn particular, Rabin said, the agency looks at white-blood cells and has developed a methodology that can be applied to search for different genes. Further detail was not provided, as it is kept confidential in order to catch athletes, he added.\n\n\"Gene editing is a little more complex than gene therapy,\" Rabin added. The anti-doping agency is working on strategies to reveal the possibility of people editing their genes for performance enhancement, he said.\n\nRabin highlighted that most of the agency's efforts focus on white blood cells as \"pretty good markers of gene manipulation\" because some evidence of manipulation will usually end up in the blood.\n\nAsked what it is doing to monitor and test athletes for gene doping, the International Olympic Committee did not comment directly but said, \"We have nothing to add to the section on gene doping in WADA's prohibited list.\"\n\nThe question now is whether the first few cases have, in fact, happened without our knowledge.\n\nModern occurrence\n\n\"I never heard anything about it except for one time, and it was around five years ago,\" said Sebastian Weber, coach of four-time Union Cycliste Internationale world champion (time trialling) Tony Martin. \"There was some buzz around a substance called AICAR,\" or 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide.\n\nAICAR is a performance-enhancing drug that the French Anti-Doping Agency suspected was used in the 2009 Tour de France; it stimulates mitochondria, the part in the muscles responsible for aerobic energy production.\n\nIn cycling, for gene doping to be effective, techniques should target both EPO levels and red blood cell production to have a higher oxygen delivery to the muscles, Weber says -- but they would also need to increase the mass and number of mitochondria in order to actually produce energy from that oxygen.\n\n\"Just because you have more oxygen, it doesn't necessary mean you also have the capacity to produce energy out of it,\" Weber said.\n\nAs AICAR was a drug, it wasn't gene doping, but it led people to wonder about what was next, he says, after this \"first step\" toward stimulating the body's mitochondria. \"That was the only time I heard people talking about the possibility of gene-doping.\"\n\nTailoring to your genes\n\nThere are other ways genetics -- and a deep knowledge of them -- could help athletes improve their performance, by understanding their physiology.\n\nFor example, project GENESIS -- focused on how applied genomics in elite sports can improve performance -- and its offshoot, the RugbyGene Project, are trying to identify which genetic characteristics help athletes succeed.\n\n\"We recognize it is not only genetic,\" said Dr. Alun Williams, an exercise geneticist at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK who works on both projects. \"Training, diet and other lifestyle habits are massive factors. But along with that, the evidence is that it's impossible to have success in sports without some genetic [factors] in your favor.\"\n\nThe researchers of these projects are hoping to identify which genes help -- or hinder -- athletes in their specific disciplines, to develop their skills in a more tailored way. For example, if an athlete has shown to have a higher genetic vulnerability to tendon injuries, scientists and coaches could reduce certain aspects of their training load over the course of the season, give longer rest periods, reduce the number of matches played in a season, or provide specific exercises and pre-habilitation workouts.\n\nBut Williams points out that the field is still at an early stage. \"This picture where certain genes (or even two or three genes) are related to a particular characteristic, like the tendon injury, is still a small bit of a bigger picture,\" he said. \"So it's very important that this information that is available is put into context.\"\n\nA different point of view\n\nSome experts argue that we're looking at it all wrong and that athletes will always use the most modern technology to seek out an advantage -- illegal or not.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Modern sports have been principally valued on the basis of record-breaking and being able to witness extraordinary performances,\" said bioethicist Andy Miah, the University of Salford Chair in Science Communication and Future Media and author of \"Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport.\" \"Even if it's not a world record, it's about trying to see something special in what humans can do, and often, that is about transcending boundaries.\"\n\nWe give athletes all sort of technology to do that, added Miah, who readily claims to \"disagree with anti-doping.\"\n\nInstead of the current scenario, in which anti-doping keeps trying to catch up with doping, Miah suggests a safer form of performance enhancement.\n\n\"If we can have a system where enhancement was actually medically supervised, then I think that is a much more safe and healthy.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/13/health/athletes-gene-editing-doping-sport-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-04-13T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Reports of death spark concern about Parkinson's drug", "text": "(CNN) Two years ago, Brendan Tyne pleaded with the Food and Drug Administration to approve a drug that he was hopeful could finally bring his mother some peace.\n\nShe could no longer move without assistance and had fallen victim to the debilitating and frightening psychosis that haunts many people with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"She thinks there are people in the house and animals are trying to get her,\" he told an FDA advisory committee.\n\nHe believed that a new medication called Nuplazid, made by San Diego-based Acadia Pharmaceuticals, was the answer.\n\nNuplazid's review was being expedited because it had been designated a \"breakthrough therapy\" -- meaning that it demonstrated \"substantial improvement\" in patients with serious or life-threatening diseases compared to treatments already on the market. Congress created this designation in 2012 in an effort to speed up the FDA's approval process, which has long been criticized for being too slow. Around 200 drugs have been granted this designation since its creation.\n\nStill, to recommend approval, the advisory committee would have to find that the drug's potential benefits outweighed its risks for its intended patients.\n\nSome FDA officials concluded that Nuplazid's public health benefit was enough to merit approval of the drug. Their argument echoed the pleas of family members and caregivers like Tyne: It could possibly help patients with no other alternative. Several of the people who spoke said their loved ones had been transformed during the clinical trials, though some said there was no way for them to know whether they were on Nuplazid or a placebo.\n\nBut the physician who led the FDA's medical review, Dr. Paul Andreason, warned that patients taking the drug during the company's clinical trials experienced serious outcomes, including death, at more than double the rate of those taking the placebo. The company's limited testing, he said, had not convinced him that the benefits outweighed the risks.\n\nI remember leaving really, really frustrated FDA advisory committee member\n\nWhile Tyne had heard about these risks, he said he \"discounted death as a real statistical possibility\" and was willing to try anything to help his mother.\n\n\"I have two young children who love their grandmother,\" he told the committee. \"If nothing is done to bring her back to some semblance of normalcy, my children will never remember their grandmother for who she is: a loving, funny, caring woman who has improved the lives of all of the loved ones who surround her. Please, I beg you, do not deprive my children and their grandmother of experiencing that love.\"\n\n'You have to take it seriously'\n\nThe committee voted 12-2 and recommended that the FDA approve Nuplazid for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis based on a six-week study of about 200 patients . Three previous studies of the drug did not show that it was effective, Andreason said in his medical review, though they showed similar risk.\n\nEven some committee members who voted in favor of the drug expressed reservations, according to the hearing transcript. \"I guess I'm hoping that the risks are going to be small, and I think the benefits for some of these people who are very sick and whose families are affected by this, I think they're probably willing to take that risk,\" one physician stated. Another committee member said she wouldn't have voted for the drug's approval if there had been a safe and effective alternative on the market. A third made a \"plea\" to the FDA to \"consider a large observational study so we can ensure that, once it goes into real-world use, that the benefits will outweigh the risks.\"\n\nIt hit the market in June 2016. As caregivers and family members rushed to get their loved ones on it, sales climbed to roughly $125 million in 2017.\n\nTyne got his mother on the drug as soon as it became available. But after trying it for months, he says he was devastated to see that it was doing nothing to halt the awful progression of the disease, and her hallucinations became more frequent and harder to manage. \"She has gone straight downhill to the point she really can't function at all,\" he said.\n\nShortly after the drug's release, patients' family members, doctors and other health care professionals started reporting \"adverse events\" possibly linked to the medication -- including deaths, life-threatening incidents, falls, insomnia, nausea and fatigue. In more than 1,000 reports, patients continued to experience hallucinations while on Nuplazid.\n\nCreatures like cats and snakes can haunt patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis, as shown in Acadia's TV commercial.\n\nIn November, an analysis released by a nonprofit health care organization, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, warned that 244 deaths had been reported to the FDA between the drug's launch and March 2017. The organization also noted that hundreds of reports suggested the drug was \"not providing the expected benefit\" or potentially worsening the condition.\n\nTracked by the FDA, these so-called \"adverse event reports\" document deaths, side effects and other issues, and can be made directly by consumers, caregivers and other medical professionals. Reports are submitted to either the FDA or to the drugmaker, which is required to pass along any it receives to the federal government. In some cases, the person filing the report is convinced the side effects were caused by the drug; in others, the reporter ascribes no cause but notes that the patient was on the drug.\n\nAn adverse event report does not mean that a suspected medication has been ruled the cause of harm and is typically not the result of an official investigation. But the FDA uses the information to monitor potential issues with a drug and can take action as needed -- updating a medication's label, for instance, or restricting its use or pulling it off the market.\n\nAfter analyzing the adverse event data for Nuplazid, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices concluded that this batch of reports \"reinforces the concerns of those who warned that (Nuplazid) might do more harm than good.\" Thomas Moore, senior scientist for drug safety and policy for the nonprofit, said the deaths are an \"important warning signal\" and warrant further review by the FDA -- and possible action, depending on what the review finds.\n\nSince the institute released its analysis, FDA data shows that the number of reported deaths has risen to more than 700. As of last June, Nuplazid was the only medication listed as \"suspect\" in at least 500 of the death reports.\n\nThis is almost unheard of to have this many deaths reported...you have to take it seriously. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research\n\nPhysicians, medical researchers and other experts told CNN that they worried that the drug had been approved too quickly, based on too little evidence that it was safe or effective. And given these mounting reports of deaths, they say that more needs to be done to assess Nuplazid's true risks.\n\n\"This is almost unheard of, to have this many deaths reported,\" said Diana Zuckerman, founder and president of the nonprofit thinktank the National Center for Health Research, adding that because reports are voluntary, potential problems may be underreported. \"You just don't see this with most new drugs -- you don't see all these reports -- so you have to take it seriously.\"\n\nAcadia and the FDA maintain that the medication's potential benefits continue to outweigh the risks and help fill a desperate need. Psychosis affects up to 50% of the roughly one million Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease, according to the FDA, and Nuplazid is the first drug to be approved to treat this specific condition.\n\nAcadia said there are a number of reasons for the higher volume of death reports. Parkinson's disease psychosis is more commonly seen in patients in the most advanced stages of the disease, meaning they are already at a high risk of death. Plus, the company distributes Nuplazid through a network of specialty pharmacies that allow them to be in more frequent contact with both patients and caregivers -- meaning it is more likely to receive reports of death, which it is required to pass along to the FDA.\n\n\"If you are actively and regularly engaging patients and/or caregivers, it is inevitable that you will see a higher number of adverse events reported, especially in an older, chronically ill patient population,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nIt said its \"benefit/risk assessment of Nuplazid remains unchanged,\" and it carefully monitors and regularly analyzes safety reports from both ongoing studies and adverse event reports. The company noted, for example, that since the drug's approval, two studies of a total of more than 300 patients with Alzheimer's disease did not find a difference in the number of deaths reported between Nuplazid and the placebo.\n\nThe company also provided CNN with a statement from Dr. Joseph Jankovic, professor of neurology and an expert on movement disorders at Baylor College of Medicine. \"I have accumulated a great deal of experience with this drug,\" Jankovic said in the statement. \"While not all patients are completely satisfied, many of my patients have experienced marked improvement in their visual hallucinations, paranoia and other psychotic symptoms.\"\n\nIn an interview this week, FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb was asked by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta about his thoughts on drugs that receive expedited reviews and then prompt concerns about safety once they become available, like Nuplazid. While Gottlieb didn't want to comment on a specific product, he said he is \"familiar with the circumstances\" and that it's very important for the agency to make sure it is \"appropriately balancing\" safety with medical need. He said this is a flexible standard, however, and there may be more tolerance for risk in situations where there is a significant need and patients don't have an alternative.\n\nJUST WATCHED FDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH FDA chief: Opioids are biggest crisis we face 03:54\n\n\"You've seen us take regulatory action recently in the post-market setting to limit the use of drugs when new safety concerns became known,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA told CNN it will continue to monitor the adverse event reports and review the drug's safety. It added that Nuplazid's \"complex safety profile,\" recognized at the time of its approval, resulted in a requirement that the medication carry a number of warnings on its label so that doctors could analyze potential risks and benefits before prescribing the drug.\n\nThe cases reported so far, according to the FDA, typically involved elderly patients with advanced-stage Parkinson's disease who suffer from numerous medical conditions and often take other medications that can increase the risk of death.\n\nWhat should we investigate next? Email Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken\n\n\"Based on these data, the FDA has, at this time, not identified a specific safety issue that is not already adequately described in the product labeling,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nThe FDA has required antipsychotics to carry its most severe \"black box\" warning for the treatment of elderly dementia patients, after studies found that the medications increase the risk of death in this population. Between 50% and 80% of Parkinson's patients experience dementia as the disease worsens, according to the Alzheimer's Association. Because Nuplazid is a new kind of antipsychotic that targets a different receptor in the brain, its maker claims it comes with fewer toxic side effects. Even so, Nuplazid also carries a black box warning.\n\nGeriatric psychiatrist and former FDA medical officer Susan Molchan said that the number of deaths is alarming and questioned whether patients and their families are aware of the risks associated with the drug.\n\nTo determine the true risks of Nuplazid, the researchers interviewed by CNN said, the FDA needs to require further scientific studies -- and not just rely on the reports, which are challenging to interpret and are not systematically collected. They also worried that, because the drug was already approved, these studies and any action by the FDA could take years.\n\nHundreds of adverse event reports\n\nA CNN review of several hundred adverse event reports shows that the detail provided for each case varies widely and that thorough investigations are rarely conducted -- making it difficult to determine whether Nuplazid might have been involved in the deaths of already sick and elderly patients.\n\nIn these reports, the physicians who prescribed the drug sometimes suggest that their patients likely died from complications from Parkinson's rather than because of Nuplazid. In other cases, it's unclear when exactly the patient started or stopped taking the medication. And in yet others, family members and sometimes doctors are convinced the drug contributed to the deaths.\n\nThis is exactly what I thought I was going to happen. Dr. Paul Andreason, who led the FDA medical review of Nuplazid\n\nOne report recounts the death of a 73-year-old woman in a long-term care facility who was taking Nuplazid. Just before 8 in the morning, a nurse noted that the woman was \"sleepy.\" Shortly after, she was found unresponsive and without a pulse. Paramedics were not able to revive her and, less than an hour after the nurse's visit, she was pronounced dead. While her physician didn't believe her death was \"related\" to Nuplazid, her husband was convinced that it had played a role and paid for an autopsy. It showed only that she had pre-existing heart issues and died of cardiac arrest.\n\nIn another report, an 89-year-old man was taken off the drug after experiencing a significant decline. His doctor blamed Nuplazid for his deteriorating condition. The patient died weeks later. In a third report, a woman flagged her husband's death to the FDA after he was taken to the hospital due to dehydration. After he passed away, she said, she was told by \"someone at the hospital\" that the death was connected to his use of Nuplazid.\n\nAcadia said it analyzed these reports and concluded that there \"is nothing to suggest a causal relationship to Nuplazid.\" Acadia calculated a mortality rate for Nuplazid, which it said was lower than what you'd see in the general population of Parkinson's disease psychosis patients covered by Medicare. It calculated this using deaths reported to the FDA and what it considered a conservative estimate of patients on the drug, along with Medicare claims data. However, multiple experts interviewed by CNN said that this is an unreliable calculation since it is comparing apples to oranges.\n\nWidening the patient pool\n\nIn the weeks after the Institute for Safe Medication Practices issued its report on the deaths, Acadia's stock price dropped by more than 20%. While many large investors remain bullish about the stock, some investment analysts have made public records requests to the FDA for the death reports.\n\nCurrently, Nuplazid can cost nearly $100 a day, according to wholesale pricing data from First Databank . That can add up to more than $30,000 a year for a single patient, though the amount a patient actually pays depends on factors including individual insurance coverage.\n\nAcadia expects sales of Nuplazid to at least double this year.\n\nAcadia's TV commercial shows how frightening Parkinson's disease psychosis can be.\n\nThe company, meanwhile, is forging ahead with clinical trials in an attempt to get the medication approved for use in a larger patient population: patients who have dementia-related psychosis. In October, the FDA granted its coveted breakthrough designation for this potential use as well, meaning it will also undergo a speedier review process.\n\nWhile a doctor can legally prescribe a drug for any reason, insurance companies may not approve it for uses that are not FDA-approved. So FDA approval to treat dementia patients would likely result in Nuplazid being prescribed to a much wider population, concerned medical experts told CNN.\n\n\"You would certainly hope they don't approve it for anything else,\" said Zuckerman of the National Center for Health Research, based on the current research and FDA adverse event reports. \"If they're going to approve it for another group of patients that is much, much larger -- that would be unconscionable.\n\n\"That is something they should absolutely not do given these unanswered questions about risk.\"\n\n'I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up'\n\nRoughly two years have passed since that FDA meeting, where family members and caregivers -- some of whom traveled there on Acadia's dime -- gathered with medical experts to debate the merits and potential risks of Nuplazid.\n\nAndreason, the physician who led the FDA's medical review of Nuplazid, no longer works for the agency.\n\nHe said that while he stands by the warnings he made at the time, he understands that other antipsychotics used to treat Parkinson's patients also come with an increased risk of death and that, when patients have a debilitating disease like Parkinson's, physicians and caregivers may choose a medication that improves quality of life even if it could also shorten life expectancy.\n\nHe said that he was not surprised to hear about the reports of death.\n\nKnowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up. Son of Parkinson's patient\n\n\"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen,\" he said. \"We were going to get a burst of reports of serious adverse events and deaths.\"\n\nDr. Stephanie Fox-Rawlings, a senior fellow at the National Center for Health Research who spoke against the drug's approval at the FDA committee meeting, recently told CNN she understands how desperate families in these situations are, but she does not think Nuplazid is the answer based on her review of Acadia's public research. She and Zuckerman said that, after previous studies didn't show it was effective, the drugmaker changed the way the medication's ability to improve psychosis was measured, which resulted in a positive outcome. Acadia said its studies have had different objectives and all of them have used \"consistent, appropriate, and validated assessment methodology.\"\n\n\"If patients know there is some level of benefit, they can judge their risk,\" said Fox-Rawlings. \"But if we don't even know that it does work, how do you even judge that? It's kind of a false hope.\"\n\nKim Witczak was the consumer representative on the FDA committee evaluating Nuplazid. She and the patient representative were the only two members to vote against its approval. She still can't believe it's on the market.\n\n\"I remember leaving really, really frustrated,\" she said.\n\nCNN reached two of the three family members who petitioned for Nuplazid's approval at the meeting, despite having had no experience with the drug or its clinical trials, to ask whether they tried the medication once it hit the market.\n\nOne of these was Elaine Casavant. Despite the \"staggering cost\" of the medication, she said, she was quick to get her husband on it. But after three months, he showed no improvement and they stopped the medication. She has heard success stories, however, and remains optimistic that the drug could be helping certain people.\n\nThe other person was Tyne.\n\nThe 43-year-old New Jersey resident works in New York and visits his mother every weekend at a nursing home in the Bronx. Tyne has attempted to move on from the disappointment of Nuplazid, but he still gets frustrated talking about it.\n\n\"Knowing what I know now -- that it didn't work at all -- I wouldn't have gotten my hopes up,\" he said.\n\nBut he doesn't regret trying.\n\n\"If there was something that could possibly help my mom and I didn't do it, I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror.\"\n\nDo you have information to share about Nuplazid or other drugs targeting the elderly?

She doesn't trust what comes out of her tap.\n\nIf she's by herself, she'll take her ATV. If one of her daughters is coming along, they take their four-wheel-drive truck. It takes her about seven minutes to grind up the hill before she reaches her destination: a small plastic well tapped into the side of the mountain with a 3\u00bd-foot PVC pipe.\n\nThe day CNN visited, the temperature was just above freezing, and Hope's hands shivered as she filled jug after jug with crystal-clear drinking water.\n\n\"This is what we go through to get water, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nWorkman is not the only person in Martin County, Kentucky, or America for that matter, who struggles to get clean water. Two well-publicized crises include Flint, Michigan's, lead contamination and Puerto Rico's failing water systems in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nAs our water infrastructure system ages, experts say, keeping America's water clean becomes increasingly challenging. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the nation's drinking water infrastructure a grade of D.\n\nAccording to the the society, about 1 million miles of pipes crisscross the country to deliver us clean water, much of it overseen by local municipalities that are challenged with aging hardware. Many of these pipes were laid underground nearly a century ago and are reaching the end of their life spans. As they age, they can crack, and water breaks become more common. In fact, the entire country loses nearly 6 billion gallons of water a day just to leaky pipes.\n\nFor many cash-strapped local utilities, it's difficult to find the resources to manage a problem we rarely see.\n\nFaucets run brown\n\nBut when the problem does come to the surface, it's hard to ignore. Just ask the residents of Martin County. Customers of the county's water district post videos and pictures on social media of brown cloudy water spouting out of their taps. Sometimes, it comes out looking like blue Gatorade. Sometimes, it smells like diesel fuel.\n\nLocals ask themselves, \"Just what's in the water?\"\n\nUntil several months ago, customers received notices on the back of their water bills stating that their water had been tested and found to be above federal limits of trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids . These contaminants are a reaction between the chlorine used to treat the water for bacteria and organic matter that may be found in the water or the pipes. Exposure to these chemicals could mean an increased risk of cancer.\n\nEastern Kentucky has some of the highest levels of cancer in the country due to smoking and obesity, but residents here also wonder whether their water is to blame.\n\n'We're just scared of the water'\n\nMartin County resident BarbiAnn Maynard is convinced that her mother's cancer was related to the water.\n\n\"We don't really know what to do. We're just scared of the water and have been for years,\" she said.\n\n\"You're afraid to wash your hands if you've got a cut,\" Maynard said. Taking a shower is no better. \"I don't feel like I'm getting clean. I might smell a little bit better, but I don't feel any better about it.\"\n\nDr. Don Lafferty, a local physician, feels that he's in a difficult position when patients ask him whether the water is the source of their health issues. \"I can't tell them it's safe or it isn't safe,\" he told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to be asking ... in 2018 whether or not water is causing cancer in our region.\"\n\nWhere the War on Poverty began\n\nNestled in the hills of Eastern Kentucky, Martin County has had a long history tied to coal. Between 1918 and 2015, the county produced more than 436 million tons of coal. But as the coal industry died out, Martin County struggled. Nearly 40% of its population lives at or below the federal poverty level. The unemployment rate in the county is almost double the national rate.\n\nBut poverty has been endemic to the area for years. President Lyndon Johnson came here in 1964 to launch his War on Poverty.\n\n\"In 2018, in the very place where LBJ declared war on poverty ... water is our number one issue. That's hard to imagine,\" said Gary Ball, editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper, The Mountain Citizen.\n\nWhat's happened in Martin County is a worst-case scenario that may be happening in other parts of the country, said Lindell Ormsbee, director of the Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute at the University of Kentucky.\n\n\"I think it's somewhat of a systematic representation of what's happening in a lot of other places where no one's looking. It's almost like the proverbial canary in the mine,\" Ormsbee said.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nA large part of the issue in Martin County is just hardware itself. There are about 300 miles of piping that deliver water across the county, placed up and over rocky terrain, making them even more susceptible to leaking. Today, more than half of the water that leaves the Martin County Water District treatment center doesn't make it to the faucet.\n\nWhen water systems are operating optimally, there is enough going through the pipes at a high enough pressure that debris from outside the pipe can't make its way inside. Essentially, there's so much water going through so quickly that even if there is a crack in the pipe, the water can act as a barrier. But as soon as that pressure drops or there's less water going through the pipes, there is suddenly room for soil, debris and chemical residue to sneak into the drinking water.\n\nAnd because of the leakage issues, the Water District hasn't been able to flush the water lines clean in years, said Joe Burns of the Kentucky Rural Water Association. \"As far as systematic lines, it's been years since it's even been able to be accomplished.\"\n\nBurns' group is working with the Martin County Water District to help make improvements as best as they can. They've been able to reduce the levels of byproduct contaminants to under federal limits by simply changing where they add the chlorine.\n\nBut on top of issues with the lines, there are upgrades to the water treatment facilities, pumps and meters that still need to be made.\n\nInvestments in hardware and software are needed\n\nFor a financially struggling municipality, it is hard to find resources outside raising water rates, which is difficult for a community of people who mostly live on a limited income.\n\nInfrastructure isn't just pipes and hardware, Ormsbee said; it also includes financial and technical management.\n\nSmall water systems, such as Martin County, that serve less than 10,000 customers supply water to nearly 20% of the country . In addition to infrastructure and financial challenges, many of these systems can have a difficult time attracting the technical expertise to help. In fact, small systems made up 72% of EPA violations in 2015 and 2016.\n\nSome citizens in Martin County feel that they've been forgotten. \"Appalachia has been at the forefront in helping to improve this country for many years. ... We've sent people to die in all of our country's wars. We've populated this country with people in all industries,\" Lafferty said. \"We are Americans, too.\"\n\nBall points to a new government center and a business complex in Inez, the county seat.

Their dignity, at least from outside appearances, remains intact. They haven't lost everything while chasing an insatiable high.\n\nThey are functioning heroin addicts -- people who hold down jobs, pay the bills and fool their families.\n\nFor some, addiction is genetic; they're wired this way. For others, chronic pain and lack of legal opioids landed them here. Or experimentation got them hooked and changed everything.\n\nWhat addicts have in common, according to experts, is a disease that has more to do with their brains than the substances they use. About 85% of people can take a pain pill, for example, and never crave it again.\n\nThis is a story about the others, those traveling the dangerous road of functional addiction. What works for them now, experts explain, can easily and lethally be derailed.\n\nHanging in the balance are people you may never imagine: peers, co-workers and neighbors. Loved ones, bosses and teachers. Respected members of your community who, for the benefit of everyone's understanding, want to be heard.\n\nAfter CNN gave voice last fall to addicts on skid row , the sorts we think of when we picture \"heroin addict,\" I set out to tell this overlooked part of the heroin story.\n\nBeing a functioning addict hinges on heroin use staying hush-hush, so we agreed to change the names of those willing to open up.\n\n'All smiles and happiness at work'\n\nLoving and successful parents, good schools, a great upbringing in the Midwest: Todd can't point to anything that drove him to drugs. He was a typical suburban high school student who dabbled in weed. Then, at 15, he popped a Percocet his mother left lying around while she was recovering from surgery.\n\n\"The feeling in my head was, 'I want to feel like this for the rest of my life,' \" Todd says. \"It was the perfect drug for me.\"\n\nThe 11 years since have been a dance with opioid addiction, even as he graduated from college and embarked on a successful career in corporate management. Now 26, he has gone stretches where he's been sober, but the pull is strong and keeps yanking him back.\n\nHe's done heroin for periods of time and says it's \"fantastic,\" but shooting up isn't his style. His preference, assuming he can find them, is to buy more expensive opioids. For a long time, OxyContin was his drug of choice; now he prefers Opana and, if he can't get that, Subutex.\n\nHe makes good money, which means he can afford his $350- to $600-a-week habit.\n\nHe's figured out how much to take so he doesn't feel the pains of withdrawal, which is now his goal -- rather than getting a full-on high. His sweet spot: 60 milligrams of Opana.\n\n\"I don't know how to describe withdrawal. It's like the worst flu you've ever had in your life -- and then multiply that by 1,000,\" he says. \"There's a scraping inside your brain. You're willing to do anything to feel better.\"\n\nTo avoid that hell, Todd often lives a lie. He's \"all smiles and happiness at work,\" he says, and he spins tales to guard his secret. He might say he's in one city when he's really in another. That quick trip he says he's taking to McDonald's could be to meet his dealer at Burger King. When he's used heroin, he's explained the bruises on his arm by telling people he has diabetes or an infectious disease. He once told a pharmacist he was a science teacher in need of syringes for experiments. He's invented the deaths of family members to get days off.\n\nBut death is very much a reality in his life.\n\nHis last serious girlfriend also used drugs and died from an overdose. Over the past six years, he's lost seven people he cares about to addiction.\n\nHe'd like to find love, build a relationship and have a family but says, \"It would be dishonest, and I never want to hurt anybody. That's the biggest problem.\"\n\nHe knows that he has a lot to live for, but he often forgets that and struggles to imagine a future. And because he can't stray far from his dealer, a dream he does have remains on hold indefinitely.\n\n\"I've always wanted to see the world,\" he says. \"I've never been outside the country because I can't leave. I'm f***ing chained where I'm at. It's a f***ing prison.\"\n\nThe sign of an addict\n\nThe sensation Todd had the first time he popped a Percocet, that feeling he wanted to hold onto for the rest of his life, was the giveaway. He, like 10% or 15% of people, has the disease of addiction, explains Dr. Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine\n\nWhat offers no special high for most people or may even make them feel queasy became Todd's aspiration. And part of the problem, says Gitlow, is that \"you don't know in advance what person you're going to be.\"\n\nTodd may be functioning now, but Gitlow warns that tolerances and doses often change. As an addictive disease progresses, it is also influenced by life events and stressors. What happens if Todd loses his job someday or can't afford his preferred pills?\n\n\"They all start out functioning,\" he says. \"The bulk of people taking heroin are probably functioning. It's only in the end stage that they're nodding off in an alley and have a pretty good shot of dying.\"\n\nWhat Todd needs, Gitlow says, is help from a doctor who is certified in addiction medicine and can treat his disease. The vast majority, or 80%, of those who seek appropriate treatment and adhere to their treatment recommendations do well, he says.\n\nNot a unique story\n\nIt didn't start with a pill for Lisa. Her first addiction took hold at 12, when she began cutting herself.\n\nCarving into her flesh released dopamine in her brain, giving her a high, she says. The first time she did it, she never anticipated a rush. She was overwhelmed emotionally and simply acting out. But cutting became her way to self-medicate because it offered her solace, easing the emotional pain of living in a household full of screaming.\n\nNow, at 23, Lisa opts for heroin. And because of it and other opioids she's used, \"I hurt myself a lot less.\"\n\nThe difference now is that she, like Todd, no longer seeks a high. When she shoots up each morning, she insists, \"I just do enough to stay well\" through the day and not feel physical pain.\n\nShe works hard, always has. She excelled in her college-prep private school, where she was dubbed \"gifted and talented,\" she says. She takes her job as a store manager seriously and enjoys a supportive marriage. No one at work knows that her day begins with a call to her dealer. If she has track marks, a simple long-sleeved shirt hides the evidence.\n\nHow she found heroin, she says, is not unique.\n\nLong plagued by tendonitis in her knees and two herniated discs in her back, Lisa tried everything. Steroid injections gave her migraines, and her stomach couldn't handle anti-inflammatories. Physical and aquatic therapies offered little relief, as did deep-tissue massage. Finally, four years ago, a physician wrote out a prescription for pain pills.\n\nShe found comfort in those legal opioids. But then came the crackdown on opioid prescriptions, she says, effectively ending her lawful pain management.\n\nOnce her pills ran out, she turned to buying them on the street. They were hard to find, though, and the cost became prohibitive. An old friend, a heroin user, suggested that she give his drug a try.\n\n\"I can't find pills, I'm in pain, and it's really cheap,\" she remembers telling herself. \"What happened to me is what happened to thousands and thousands of people.\"\n\nWhere she lives in Texas, near the Mexican border, the price of heroin can't be beat. One pill might cost her $50, but she can get half a gram of heroin, which is far more potent, for $20. The same product, she says, would cost up to five times as much in other parts of the country.\n\n\"If I moved somewhere where it was $100,\" she says, \"I'd quit.\"\n\nHer husband doesn't do drugs. He barely drinks. And although he'd prefer she kick the habit altogether, he's committed to being by her side -- so much that he keeps Narcan, the overdose antidote drug, in their home and has watched training videos to learn how to administer it in case she overdoses.\n\n\"He loves me enough that he's willing to stay with me,\" Lisa says. \"That's a key component to keeping me from going off the deep end.\"\n\nLisa says a small handful of friends know that she uses heroin. Everyone else, her family included, believes she's hooked on \"just pills.\" It's easier that way. Pills and other vices don't come with the same sort of judgment.\n\n\"People drink, and we think nothing of it. You do heroin, and you're the scum of the earth,\" she says. \"People will cut you out of their lives.\"\n\nEverybody's problem\n\nHeroin users weren't always \"the scum of the earth.\" In the late 19th century, it was a trademark name for an over-the-counter drug made by Bayer.\n\nToday, there are politics behind which drugs are demonized and which aren't, and much of that is rooted in racism, says Dr. Michael Miller, who preceded Gitlow as president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\n\nWhite socialites snorting cocaine in an Aspen ski lodge are forgiven, while inner-city blacks smoking crack -- just another form of cocaine -- are vilified and locked away, Miller explains. Heroin was romanticized when musicians used it, he says, but after black kids in coastal cities got hold of it, the perception changed and stuck.\n\nNow, with the explosion of the opioid epidemic and the emergence of heroin as a less expensive alternative, it's become everybody's problem -- white or black, rich or poor, on the coasts or in middle America, no matter whether you live in a city, suburb or rural community.\n\nThat's how Lisa got roped in and learned to keep a secret.\n\nShe admits that the management of her addiction hinges in large part on her husband being by her side. But what if he leaves? What if life tosses her another kind of doozy? How much heroin would she need to ease her pain then?\n\n\"She has no coping skills. She's right at the edge,\" Gitlow says. \"What if her dealer gets arrested and her new dealer mixes in fentanyl? Boom. She's dead.\"\n\n'Like downing a beer'\n\nNot everyone I spoke to considers themselves addicts. Enter Matthew.\n\nFor as long as Matthew can remember, he's battled anxiety and depression. Beyond prescriptions like Xanax or Valium, he began self-medicating at 19 with marijuana and LSD, he says.\n\nAn arrest for possession of pot and LSD with intent to distribute landed him on probation. Facing regular drug tests that would detect cannabis, he turned to harder drugs that wouldn't stay in his urine as long. That's how Matthew, 28, first tried oxycodone.\n\nLater, a doctor would prescribe opioids for chronic stomach pain, a condition he's had for six years.\n\nIt's the sort of pain, he says, that used to leave him racing to bathrooms so frequently, he couldn't keep a job. Multiple GI doctors have tried to help him. Only prescribed opioids and marijuana have offered relief.\n\nRaised in the Eastern US, he now lives in rural Northern California and works as a consultant in the cannabis industry. He doesn't hide his marijuana use or his dependence on pain medications.\n\nIt's the powdered heroin he purchases on the dark net, the stuff he snorts in the bathroom a few times a day, that he keeps to himself. He says he uses it only when his prescriptions or insurance coverage lapse.\n\nHe's never used heroin intravenously. Having gone back and forth between pharmaceuticals and illegal supplies, he says he's able to use a milligram scale to carefully measure how much of the powder to take.\n\n\"It's similar to a dose of Percocet.\" he says. \"The effect would be like downing a beer or a cocktail.\"\n\nHe doesn't use a lot and says he snorts only about $5 of heroin a day. He's stopped in spurts and has written down pro and con lists to see whether he can move on. The pros keep winning out.\n\n\"I just don't find sober me is the best me,\" he says.\n\nHaving a secret can be isolating, he says, but otherwise, heroin has not hindered his life. Rather, Matthew says, \"It's changed my life for the better.\"\n\nNot only does it help with the pain, he says, it constipates him, allowing him to ditch the bathroom and get out of the house.\n\n\"I'm dependent,\" he says. \"But I wouldn't necessarily call myself an addict.\"\n\nThe crippling truth\n\nMatthew is kidding himself, experts say.\n\n\"Denial is a crippling component of addictive disease,\" Gitlow said. \"Here we have a well-documented illustration of that deadly component.\"\n\nStarting at 19, the signs were there when Matthew turned to drugs rather than \"conventional coping mechanisms,\" Gitlow explains. Someone without the addictive disease might have tried those drugs for temporary relief but then realized they weren't worth the long-term risk.\n\nMatthew's belief that he doesn't have a problem, Gitlow says, is no different from a man with hypertension or diabetes pretending there's nothing wrong with him.\n\nPlus, using heroin and other opioids changes brain chemistry, says Siobhan Morse, director of clinical services for the Foundations Recovery Network.\n\nThe natural way a body manages pain or stress, Morse says, is by producing endorphins.\n\n\"If you're giving it the artificial substance,\" she explains, the brain thinks it doesn't have to make the real thing. \"So when you take away the artificial substance, everything is so painful.\"\n\nAnd for people like Matthew who have coexisting mental health issues such as anxiety or depression, self-medication with opioids can make those matters worse, Morse adds. She describes the combination as a \"moving target.\"\n\nEventually, she and other experts say, Matthew's drug use will catch up with him.\n\n\"I've never met anyone who's indefinitely held it down being a heroin addict,\" Morse says.\n\nThe fall of 'Superwoman'\n\nRebecca has been using for more than three decades -- longer than Matthew, Todd and Lisa combined. She is surprised to still be alive.\n\nShe grew up in an upper-middle-class household in a tony suburb in the South where she was raised more by the housekeeper than her parents. Her mother was checked out; her father had mistresses and often traveled.\n\n\"I didn't have any boundaries,\" says Rebecca, 59. \"I could do whatever I wanted, which was a recipe for disaster.\"\n\nStarting at 12, she tried every narcotic she could find. At 15, the man who was her drug dealer and boyfriend introduced her to heroin.\n\n\"I was in love,\" she says of the drug. \"It became the love of my life.\"\n\nOne day, she was sleeping on the couch in her family's home when an older sister pinned her down, rolled up one of her sleeves and called out her track marks.\n\n\"Mom didn't bat an eye,\" Rebecca remembers. Instead, she shrugged it off, saying, \"Jewish people aren't addicts.\"\n\nHer father, when he was around, was more a friend than a parent. He partied with Rebecca and gave her Quaaludes, she says.\n\nRebecca eventually married the drug dealer-boyfriend, and they had a daughter. But the marriage was short-lived.\n\nDivorced and 24, Rebecca went into treatment after her daughter turned 3. Rebecca knew that she was unfit to be a parent and feared she'd lose her daughter forever. It was the first of some 20 times she'd check into a treatment facility for help.\n\nAlong the way, she re-married; husband No. 2 died of a heroin overdose.\n\nRebecca met her third husband in treatment and stayed sober for eight years. They had two more children and a comfortable lifestyle, enjoying the sort of privileges she knew growing up. But when this marriage fell apart, so did she.\n\n\"That was when I started to spiral down,\" Rebecca says. \"As soon as I started using, it was immediate. ... It was like I never stopped using.\"\n\nEven as Rebecca returned to heroin, spending $100 or more a day, she built a career in corporate travel, working for big-name companies.\n\n\"As long as I didn't run out [of heroin] and get sick, I was like Superwoman,\" she says of her job performance. \"If I had come in and said I was a heroin addict, people would have laughed.\"\n\nYears of use caught up with her. Lunchtime runs to see her dealer grew longer and became lies about flat tires or broken-down cars. She bounced around between five or six companies, taking extended leaves to go into treatment or try to detox at home. She kept overdosing. A $30,000 mistake at work got her fired.\n\n\"People kept saying, 'You're going to die,' \" Rebecca says. \"The problem with me wasn't that I was going to die, it's that I was going to live.\"\n\nHer kids were mostly raised by other family members and knew her at her worst. They'd see her after overdoses and visit her in the \"nasty places\" she called home. \"It was just awful,\" says Rebecca, who's still working to repair the relationships she frayed.\n\nToday, Rebecca is three years sober.\n\nThe last time she entered treatment, she says, \"something clicked, and I remember thinking, 'I can't do this anymore.' \"\n\nShe was \"sick and tired of being sick and tired,\" she says. \"I didn't have it in me anymore to keep doing what it took to stay high.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRebecca is not the only member of her family who's struggled. One relative is an alcoholic, another is also a heroin addict, and a third -- who won't touch heroin because of Rebecca -- is hooked on pain pills.\n\n\"It's in the genes,\" Rebecca says. \"No doubt.\"\n\nShe has seven grandchildren and is determined to be a better grandmother than she was a parent. She lives with a friend in an apartment and works part time for a sober living community.\n\n\"If there's any regret, it's that I've missed decades,\" Rebecca says. \"I just thought I wasn't going to live, so I never worried about getting old.\"\n\nShe is fighting to make the rest of her life matter, all the while knowing -- based on decades of experience -- how easily she could slip again.\n\nOne lapse, one moment of weakness or overconfidence that she can handle it, and everything Rebecca is building up could come crashing down and, quite possibly, bury her.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/27/health/functioning-heroin-addicts/index.html", "published": "2018-02-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "For doctors, more opioid prescriptions bring more money", "text": "(CNN) As tens of thousands of Americans die from prescription opioid overdoses each year, an exclusive analysis by CNN and researchers at Harvard University found that opioid manufacturers are paying physicians huge sums of money -- and the more opioids a doctor prescribes, the more money he or she makes.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, opioid manufacturers paid hundreds of doctors across the country six-figure sums for speaking, consulting and other services. Thousands of other doctors were paid over $25,000 during that time.\n\nPhysicians who prescribed particularly large amounts of the drugs were the most likely to get paid.\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen this, and it's really important,\" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, a senior scientist at the Institute for Behavioral Health at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University, where he is co-director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative.\n\n\"It smells like doctors being bribed to sell narcotics, and that's very disturbing,\" said Kolodny, who is also the executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing.\n\nThe Harvard researchers said it's not clear whether the payments encourage doctors to prescribe a company's drug or whether pharmaceutical companies seek out and reward doctors who are already high prescribers.\n\n\"I don't know if the money is causing the prescribing or the prescribing led to the money, but in either case, it's potentially a vicious cycle. It's cementing the idea for these physicians that prescribing this many opioids is creating value,\" said Dr. Michael Barnett, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nCNN spoke with two women who've struggled with opioid addiction, and they described the sense of betrayal they felt when they learned that their doctors had received large sums of money from the manufacturers of the drugs that had created such havoc in their lives.\n\nCarey Ballou said she trusted her doctor and figured that if he was prescribing opioids, it must be because they were the best option for her pain.\n\nThen she learned that opioid manufacturers paid her doctor more than a million dollars over two years.\n\n\"Once I found out he was being paid, I thought, 'was it really in my best interest, or was it in his best interest?' \" she said.\n\nTo do the analysis, CNN -- along with Barnett and Harvard's Dr. Anupam Jena -- examined two federal government databases. One tracks payments by drug companies to doctors, and the other tracks prescriptions that doctors write to Medicare recipients.\n\nThe CNN/Harvard analysis looked at 2014 and 2015, during which time more than 811,000 doctors wrote prescriptions to Medicare patients. Of those, nearly half wrote at least one prescription for opioids.\n\nFifty-four percent of those doctors -- more than 200,000 physicians -- received a payment from pharmaceutical companies that make opioids.\n\nDoctors were more likely to get paid by drug companies if they prescribed a lot of opioids -- and they were more likely to get paid a lot of money.\n\nAmong doctors in the top 25th percentile of opioid prescribers by volume, 72% received payments. Among those in the top fifth percentile, 84% received payments. Among the very biggest prescribers -- those in the top 10th of 1% -- 95% received payments.\n\nOn average, doctors whose opioid prescription volume ranked among the top 5% nationally received twice as much money from the opioid manufacturers, compared with doctors whose prescription volume was in the median. Doctors in the top 1% of opioid prescribers received on average four times as much money as the typical doctor. Doctors in the top 10th of 1%, on average, received nine times more money than the typical doctor.\n\n\"The correlation you found is very powerful,\" said David Rothman, director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. \"What's amazing about the findings is not simply that money counts but that more money counts even more.\"\n\nPaying doctors for speaking, consulting and other services is legal. It's defended as a way for experts in their fields to share important experience and information about medications, but it has long been a controversial practice.\n\nPharmaceutical company payments to doctors are not unique to opioids. Drug companies pay doctors billions of dollars for various services. In 2015, 48% of physicians received some pharmaceutical payment\n\nDr. Steven Stanos, president of the American Academy of Pain Medicine, said he wasn't surprised that doctors who frequently prescribe a drug are often chosen and paid to give speeches about the drug to other doctors.\n\n\"They know those medicines, and so they're going to be more likely to prescribe those because they have a better understanding,\" Stanos said, adding that some of the money paid to doctors may have been to teach other doctors about new \"abuse-deterrent\" opioid drugs.\n\nStanos' group accepted nearly $1.2 million from five of the largest opioid manufacturers in the United States between 2012 and 2017, according to a recent report by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nStanos said the money was used for various projects, including courses on safe opioid prescribing.\n\n\"I would obviously hope that a physician would not prescribe based on some type of kickback or anything like that, that they'd obviously be prescribing [in] the best interest of the patient,\" he said.\n\nBut Dr. Daniel Carlat, former director of the Prescription Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, said the CNN and Harvard findings are in line with other studies suggesting that money from drug companies does influence a doctor's prescribing habits.\n\n\"It's not proof positive, but it's another very significant data point in the growing evidence base that marketing payments from drug companies are not good for medicine and not good for patient care,\" said Carlat, a psychiatrist who blogs about conflicts of interest. \"It makes me extremely concerned.\"\n\nBarnett, one of the Harvard researchers who worked with CNN, said pharmaceutical companies pay doctors for a reason.\n\n\"It's not like they're spending this money and just letting it go out into the ether,\" he said. \"They wouldn't be spending this money if it weren't effective.\"\n\nAccording to a statement by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, drug companies support mandatory and ongoing training for prescribers on the appropriate treatment of pain.\n\n\"PhRMA supports a number of policies to ensure patients' legitimate medical needs are met, while establishing safeguards that prevent overprescribing,\" according to the statement from the group.\n\nAngela Cantone at her home in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n'I trusted my doctor'\n\nAngela Cantone says she wishes she had known that opioid manufacturers were paying her doctor hundreds of thousands of dollars; it might have prompted her to question his judgment.\n\nShe says Dr. Aathirayen Thiyagarajah, a pain specialist in Greenville, South Carolina, prescribed her an opioid called Subsys for abdominal pain from Crohn's disease for nearly 2\u00bd years, from March 2013 through July 2015.\n\nSubsys is an ultrapowerful form of fentanyl, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n\"He said it would do wonders for me, and it was really simple and easy. You just spray it in your mouth,\" Cantone said.\n\nShe says Subsys helped her pain, but it left her in \"a zombie-like\" state. She couldn't be left alone with her three young children, two of whom have autism and other special needs.\n\n\"I blacked out all the time. I'd find myself on the kitchen floor or the front lawn,\" she said.\n\nShe says that if she missed even one day of the drug, she had uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nShe said she brought her concerns to Thiyagarajah, but he assured her it couldn't be the Subsys that was causing her health problems.\n\n\"I trusted him. I trusted my doctor as you trust the police officer that's directing traffic when the light is out,\" she said.\n\nShe says that when she eventually asked Thiyagarajah to switch her to a non-opioid medication, he became belligerent.\n\n\"He said it was Subsys or nothing,\" she said.\n\nAngela Cantone holds an opioid called Subsys that her doctor prescribed to treat her prain from Crohn's disease.\n\nCantone would later learn that from August 2013 through December 2016, the company that makes Subsys paid Thiyagarajah more than $200,000, according to Open Payments , the federal government database that tracks payments from pharmaceutical companies to doctors.\n\nCNN compared the $190,000 he received from 2014 to 2015 with other prescribers nationwide in the same medical specialty and found that he received magnitudes more than the average for his peers.\n\nNearly all of the payments were for fees for speaking, training, education and consulting.\n\nCantone is now suing Thiyagarajah, accusing him of setting out to \"defraud and deceive\" her for \"the sole purpose of increasing prescriptions, sales, and consumption of Subsys to increase ... profits.\"\n\nThrough his attorney, Thiyagarajah denied any wrongdoing but declined to comment on this story due to the pending litigation.\n\nIn a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit, Thiyagarajah denied all of the allegations against him and said that all medical care provided to Cantone was \"reasonable and appropriate and in keeping with the standard of care.\"\n\nHis attorney, E. Brown Parkinson, said the doctor is currently practicing medicine, alternating weeks between his practices in South Carolina and New York.\n\nThiyagarajah might be expected to write a relatively high number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers, given that he's board-certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation with a subspecialty in pain medicine.\n\nBut he wrote an unusually high number of prescriptions for Subsys and other opioids even when compared with other doctors with the same certifications.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, physicians with Thiyagarajah's certifications wrote an average of 3.7 opioid prescriptions per Medicare patient per year, according to the analysis by CNN and Harvard. Thiyagarajah, however, annually wrote more than seven opioid prescriptions per patient per year.\n\nAfter about two years on Subsys, Cantone says, she took herself off the drug cold turkey.\n\nAccording to an affidavit by an investigator for the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thiyagarajah's office was inspected by the agency in June 2015 and found to be prescribing another opioid, buprenorphine, \"for non-legitimate medical need\" in violation of federal law.\n\nIn March 2016, the agent conducted another inspection and seized 45 medical records related to Subsys.\n\nThe DEA did a compliance review and referred its findings to the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Robert Murphy, associate special agent in charge of the agency's Atlanta Field Division.\n\nCantone is also suing Insys, the company that makes Subsys. Insys denied allegations of wrongdoing in a court filing responding to Cantone's lawsuit.\n\nSeparate from Cantone's lawsuit, John Kapoor, the founder and largest shareholder of Insys, was arrested and arraigned in federal court in October on charges of bribing doctors to overprescribe the drug.\n\n\"Dr. Kapoor engaged in no wrongdoing and refutes all of the charges in the strongest possible terms,\" said Tom Becker, a spokesman for Kapoor. \"He looks forward to being fully vindicated after having his day in court.\"\n\nKapoor resigned from the Insys board of directors in October, according to a company news release\n\nSeveral other Insys executives were arrested in connection with an alleged racketeering scheme.\n\nSeparately, Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, is conducting an investigation into the opioid industry.\n\nAccording to her investigation and the federal indictment, Insys used a combination of tactics , such as falsifying medical records, misleading insurance companies and providing kickbacks to doctors in league with the company.\n\nSaeed Motahari, president and CEO of Insys, wrote a letter in September to McCaskill, noting that he was \"concerned about certain mistakes and unacceptable actions of former Insys employees.\" He added that most of the field-based sales staff were no longer with the company.\n\n\"I stand with you and share the desire to address the serious national challenge related to the misuse and abuse of opioids that has led to addiction and unnecessary deaths and has caused so much pain to families and communities around the country,\" Motahari added.\n\nThe analysis\n\nSometimes, pharmaceutical companies pay doctors to do medical research. They also pay doctors for promotional work: for example, to speak with other doctors about the benefits of a drug.\n\nAmong the doctors who prescribe the highest volume of opioids, the CNN/Harvard analysis found that the largest amount of money was paid for that second category, which includes speaking fees, consulting, travel and food.\n\nConcerns about payments to doctors by opioid manufacturers were brought to light last year in a study by researchers at Boston University.\n\nSeveral studies published in medical journals in recent years have found an association between payments by pharmaceutical companies for various types of drugs and doctors' prescribing habits.\n\nFor example, researchers at the University of North Carolina examined the two government databases analyzed by CNN and Harvard and found that when doctors received payments from manufacturers of certain cancer drugs, they were more likely to prescribe those drugs to their patients.\n\n\"This study suggests that conflicts of interest with the pharmaceutical industry may influence oncologists in high-stakes treatment decisions for patients with cancer,\" the authors concluded.\n\nDr. Patrice Harris, a spokeswoman for the American Medical Association, said that the CNN and Harvard data raised \"fair questions\" but that such analyses show only an association between payments and prescribing habits and don't prove that one causes the other.\n\nIt's \"not a cause and effect relationship,\" said Harris, chairwoman of the association's opioid task force, adding that more research should be done on the relationship between payments and prescriptions.\n\n\"[We] strongly oppose inappropriate, unethical interactions between physicians and industry,\" she added. \"But we know that not all interactions are unethical or inappropriate.\"\n\nHarris added that relationships between doctors and industry are ethical and appropriate if they \"can help drive innovation in patient care and provide significant resources for professional medical education that ultimately benefits patients.\"\n\nStanos, the pain physician, said a doctor who gets paid by a pharmaceutical company and prescribes that company's drug might truly and legitimately believe that the drug is the best option for the patient.\n\n\"I hope physicians that do promotional talks prescribe because they think the medicine has a benefit,\" he said.\n\nBut Jena, one of the two Harvard researchers who collaborated on the CNN analysis, said he worries that money from opioid manufacturers -- especially large amounts of money -- could influence a doctor to prescribe opioids over less dangerous options.\n\n\"Every decision, every recommendation a physician makes, should be in the best interest of the patient and not a combination of the patient's interest and the financial interest of the doctor,\" said Jena, associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\"If we lived in a different world where none of these payments to physicians occurred, how many fewer Americans would have [been prescribed] opioids, and how many fewer deaths would have occurred?\" he asked.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2015, more than 183,000 people in the United States died from overdoses related to prescription opioids, according to the CDC . In October, President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health emergency\n\nAt least one company has decided to stop paying doctors for promotional activities such as speaking engagements.\n\nPurdue Pharma discontinued its speakers program for the opioids OxyContin and Butrans at the end of 2016 and the program for Hysingla, another opioid, in November, according to company spokesman Robert Josephson.\n\n\"We have restructured and significantly reduced our commercial operation and will no longer be promoting opioids to prescribers,\" a company statement said.\n\nMore than $1 million in three years\n\nThough Thiyagarajah's opioid prescription rates were particularly high, many other doctors who have prescribed large amounts of opioids have also been paid large amounts of money by pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.\n\nSeveral patients have filed lawsuits against these high prescribers.\n\nFrom August 2013 through December 2016, Dr. Steven Simon of Overland Park, Kansas, was paid nearly $1.1 million by companies that make opioid painkillers, according to the federal Open Payments database\n\nMost of the payments were fees for speaking, training and education.\n\nBallou, one of his patients, says she remembers Simon bragging about how drug companies were flying him across the country to give lectures to other doctors.\n\n\"He said he was going to Miami, and they were going to give him a convertible, and he was going to stay in the best hotel and eat the best Cuban food he'd ever had,\" said Ballou, who filed a lawsuit against Simon after she says she became addicted to opioids.\n\nSimon's lawyer, James Wyrsch, said he would not comment on pending litigation.\n\nIn court documents, he asked for the case to be dismissed, saying in part that Ballou's complaints that Simon improperly prescribed Subsys were \"simply incorrect.\"\n\nBridget Patton, a spokeswoman for the FBI's Kansas City field office, said federal agents went to the office where Simon works, Mid-America PolyClinic, in July.\n\nThe clinic said in a statement that it is \"fully and willingly cooperating with all investigations\" and that Simon has not been employed there since July 24.\n\n\"We had a lawful presence at that facility,\" Patton said. She declined to say whether investigating Simon himself was the purpose of the FBI visit.\n\nThe owner of the pain clinic, Dr. Srinivas Nalamachu, told The Kansas City Star that the agents showed up with a search warrant for Simon's medical records involving fentanyl prescriptions.\n\nSimon and his lawyer told CNN they couldn't comment due to the pending litigation.\n\nBallou said that when she was Simon's patient, it didn't give her pause that the same doctor who was prescribing opioids to her was also taking money from the companies that made the drugs.\n\nBut now she looks back with anger.\n\nA Mother's Day card Angela Cantone's daugher made for her reads, \"Best of all mother likes to sleep,\" alluding to the many instances when Cantone says her opioid medication caused her to pass out.\n\nCantone, the patient who went to Thiyagarajah, the pain specialist in South Carolina, looks back with sadness.\n\nShe cries as she remembers the Mother's Day card her daughter made her in preschool. The teacher asked each child what their mother liked to do and wrote it on the card.\n\nHer card said her mother liked to sleep.\n\n\"Instead of saying 'she gives me hugs and kisses or takes me to the park,' it was the years of her finding me on the floor,\" Cantone said. \"I feel like I failed as a parent.\"\n\nShe becomes angry when she thinks about the hundreds of thousands of dollars her doctor was paid by the drug company.\n\n\"The medication that was being prescribed to me was for his benefit, not my own,\" she said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/11/health/prescription-opioid-payments-eprise/index.html", "published": "2018-03-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "State launches Aetna probe after stunning admission", "text": "(CNN) California's insurance commissioner has launched an investigation into Aetna after learning a former medical director for the insurer admitted under oath he never looked at patients' records when deciding whether to approve or deny care.\n\nCalifornia Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones expressed outrage after CNN showed him a transcript of the testimony and said his office is looking into how widespread the practice is within Aetna.\n\n\"If the health insurer is making decisions to deny coverage without a physician actually ever reviewing medical records, that's of significant concern to me as insurance commissioner in California -- and potentially a violation of law,\" he said.\n\nAetna, the nation's third-largest insurance provider with 23.1 million customers, told CNN it looked forward to \"explaining our clinical review process\" to the commissioner.\n\nThe California probe centers on a deposition by Dr. Jay Ken Iinuma, who served as medical director for Aetna for Southern California from March 2012 to February 2015, according to the insurer.\n\nDuring the deposition, the doctor said he was following Aetna's training, in which nurses reviewed records and made recommendations to him.\n\nJones said his expectation would be \"that physicians would be reviewing treatment authorization requests,\" and that it's troubling that \"during the entire course of time he was employed at Aetna, he never once looked at patients' medical records himself.\"\n\n\"It's hard to imagine that in that entire course in time, there weren't any cases in which a decision about the denial of coverage ought to have been made by someone trained as a physician, as opposed to some other licensed professional,\" Jones told CNN.\n\n\"That's why we've contacted Aetna and asked that they provide us information about how they are making these claims decisions and why we've opened this investigation.\"\n\nThe insurance commissioner said Californians who believe they may have been adversely affected by Aetna's decisions should contact his office\n\nMembers of the medical community expressed similar shock, saying Iinuma's deposition leads to questions about Aetna's practices across the country.\n\n\"Oh my God. Are you serious? That is incredible,\" said Dr. Anne-Marie Irani when told of the medical director's testimony. Irani is a professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU and a former member of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology's board of directors.\n\n\"This is potentially a huge, huge story and quite frankly may reshape how insurance functions,\" said Dr. Andrew Murphy, who, like Irani, is a renowned fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. He recently served on the academy's board of directors.\n\nThe Gillen Washington case\n\nGillen Washington, 23, says he hopes to force change at Aetna.\n\nThe deposition by Aetna's former medical director came as part of a lawsuit filed against Aetna by a college student who suffers from a rare immune disorder. The case is expected to go to trial later this week in California Superior Court.\n\nGillen Washington, 23, is suing Aetna for breach of contract and bad faith, saying he was denied coverage for an infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) when he was 19. His suit alleges Aetna's \"reckless withholding of benefits almost killed him.\"\n\nAetna has rejected the allegations, saying Washington failed to comply with their requests for blood work. Washington, who was diagnosed with common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID, in high school, became a new Aetna patient in January 2014 after being insured by Kaiser.\n\nAetna initially paid for his treatments after each infusion, which can cost up to $20,000. But when Washington's clinic asked Aetna to pre-authorize a November 2014 infusion, Aetna says it was obligated to review his medical record. That's when it saw his last blood work had been done three years earlier for Kaiser.\n\nDespite being told by his own doctor's office that he needed to come in for new blood work, Washington failed to do so for several months until he got so sick he ended up in the hospital with a collapsed lung.\n\nOnce his blood was tested, Aetna resumed covering his infusions and pre-certified him for a year. Despite that, according to Aetna, Washington continued to miss infusions.\n\nWashington's suit counters that Aetna ignored his treating physician, who appealed on his behalf months before his hospitalization that the treatment was medically necessary \"to prevent acute and long-term problems.\"\n\n\"Aetna is blaming me for what happened,\" Washington told CNN. \"I'll just be honest, it's infuriating to me. I want Aetna to be made to change.\"\n\nDuring his videotaped deposition in October 2016, Iinuma -- who signed the pre-authorization denial -- said he never read Washington's medical records and knew next to nothing about his disorder.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin can cost as much as $20,000 per treatment. It helps patients like Gillen Washington stave off infection.\n\nQuestioned about Washington's condition, Iinuma said he wasn't sure what the drug of choice would be for people who suffer from his condition.\n\nIinuma further says he's not sure what the symptoms are for the disorder or what might happen if treatment is suddenly stopped for a patient.\n\n\"Do I know what happens?\" the doctor said. \"Again, I'm not sure. ... I don't treat it.\"\n\nIinuma said he never looked at a patient's medical records while at Aetna. He says that was Aetna protocol and that he based his decision off \"pertinent information\" provided to him by a nurse.\n\n\"Did you ever look at medical records?\" Scott Glovsky, Washington's attorney, asked Iinuma in the deposition.\n\n\"No, I did not,\" the doctor says, shaking his head.\n\n\"So as part of your custom and practice in making decisions, you would rely on what the nurse had prepared for you?\" Glovsky asks.\n\n\"Correct.\"\n\nIinuma said nearly all of his work was conducted online. Once in a while, he said, he might place a phone call to the nurse for more details.\n\nHow many times might he call a nurse over the course of a month?\n\n\"Zero to one,\" he said.\n\nGlovsky told CNN he had \"never heard such explosive testimony in two decades of deposing insurance company review doctors.\"\n\nAetna's response\n\nAetna defended Iinuma, who is no longer with the company, saying in its legal brief that he relied on his \"years of experience\" as a trained physician in making his decision about Washington's treatment and that he was following Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletin appropriately.\n\n\"Dr. Iinuma's decision was correct,\" Aetna said in court papers. \"Plaintiff has asserted throughout this litigation that Dr. Iinuma had no medical basis for his decision that 2011 lab tests were outdated and that Dr. Iinuma's decision was incorrect. Plaintiff is wrong on both counts.\"\n\nGillen Washington receives an infusion of the medicine needed to boost his immune system. He calls it \"the magic juice.\"\n\nIn its trial brief, Aetna said: \"Given that Aetna does not directly provide medical care to its members, Aetna needs to obtain medical records from members and their doctors to evaluate whether services are 'medically necessary.' Aetna employs nurses to gather the medical records and coordinate with the offices of treating physicians, and Aetna employs doctors to make the actual coverage-related determinations.\n\n\"In addition to applying their clinical judgment, the Aetna doctors and nurses use Aetna's Clinical Policy Bulletins ('CPBs') to determine what medical records to request, and whether those records satisfy medical necessity criteria to support coverage. These CPBs reflect the current standard of care in the medical community. They are frequently updated, and are publicly available for any treating physician to review.\"\n\nJones, the California insurance commissioner, said he couldn't comment specifically on Washington's case, but what drew his interest was the medical director's admission of not looking at patients' medical records.\n\n\"What I'm responding to is the portion of his deposition transcript in which he said as the medical director, he wasn't actually reviewing medical records,\" Jones told CNN.\n\nHe said his investigation will review every individual denial of coverage or pre-authorization during the medical director's tenure to determine \"whether it was appropriate or not for that decision to be made by someone other than a physician.\"\n\nIf the probe determines that violations occurred, he said, California insurance code sets monetary penalties for each individual violation.\n\nCNN has made numerous phone calls to Iinuma's office for comment but has not heard back. Heather Richardson, an attorney representing Aetna, declined to answer any questions.\n\nAsked about the California investigation, Aetna gave this written statement to CNN:\n\n\"We have yet to hear from Commissioner Jones but look forward to explaining our clinical review process.\n\n\"Aetna medical directors are trained to review all available medical information -- including medical records -- to make an informed decision. As part of our review process, medical directors are provided all submitted medical records, and also receive a case synopsis and review performed by a nurse.\n\n\"Medical directors -- and all of our clinicians -- take their duties and responsibilities as medical professionals incredibly seriously. Similar to most other clinical environments, our medical directors work collaboratively with our nurses who are involved in these cases and factor in their input as part of the decision-making process.\"\n\nGillen Washington became emaciated and gravely ill after four months without treatment.\n\n'A huge admission'\n\nDr. Arthur Caplan, founding director of the division of medical ethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, described Iinuma's testimony as \"a huge admission of fundamental immorality.\"\n\n\"People desperate for care expect at least a fair review by the payer. This reeks of indifference to patients,\" Caplan said, adding the testimony shows there \"needs to be more transparency and accountability\" from private, for-profit insurers in making these decisions.\n\nMurphy, the former American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology board member, said he was \"shocked\" and \"flabbergasted\" by the medical director's admission.\n\n\"This is something that all of us have long suspected, but to actually have an Aetna medical director admit he hasn't even looked at medical records, that's not good,\" said Murphy, who runs an allergy and immunology practice west of Philadelphia.\n\n\"If he has not looked at medical records or engaged the prescribing physician in a conversation -- and decisions were made without that input -- then yeah, you'd have to question every single case he reviewed.\"\n\nMurphy said when he and other doctors seek a much-needed treatment for a patient, they expect the medical director of an insurance company to have considered every possible factor when deciding on the best option for care.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"We run into the prior authorization issues when we are renewing therapy, when the patient's insurance changes or when an insurance company changes requirements,\" he said.\n\n\"Dealing with these denials is very time consuming. A great deal of nursing time is spent filling and refilling out paperwork trying to get the patient treatment.\n\n\"If that does not work, then physicians need to get involved and demand medical director involvement, which may or may not occur in a timely fashion -- or sometimes not at all,\" he said. \"It's very frustrating.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/11/health/aetna-california-investigation/index.html", "published": "2018-02-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Common myths about bloating, deflated", "text": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is upon us, which means in just a couple of months, it will be time to deflate from holiday calorie overload. But before you feast, consider this: Though excess calories consumed during meals can certainly contribute to a \"bloated\" or full feeling, along with weight gain, there are many other possible reasons why you may feel like you've gone up a jeans size after eating. For these causes of bloating, the popular advice you might find on a Google search isn't likely to help.\n\n\"We're using the same word to refer to 50 different things, and so you have no idea if what you read online is referring to the same type of bloating you are experiencing,\" said Tamara Duker Freuman, a registered dietitian who specializes in digestive disorders and author of the forthcoming book \" The Bloated Belly Whisperer .\"\n\nBelow are some myths, debunked, to give you a better sense of what bloating really is, what it isn't and what you can do about it.\n\nMyth 1: All bloating has a common cause.\n\nFeeling \"overly full\" or experiencing discomfort after eating or having a stomach that is noticeably distended might seem like similar bloating symptoms, but that doesn't mean the cause is the same for each.\n\n\"People most often come in saying they are 'bloated,' but what they mean by that is quite varied, and I usually need to do quite a bit of digging to really understand what it means to them. It is a very subjective sensation,\" said Dr. Yevgenia Pashinsky, a gastroenterologist and clinical instructor of medicine and gastroenterology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.\n\nOften, people will come in with a self-diagnosis, \"which often has little to do with the actual causes of their symptoms,\" Pashinsky added.\n\nTechnically, anything you put in your GI tract has the potential to cause bloating. But according to Pashinsky, some people are more susceptible to bloating than others, including those with conditions such as gastroparesis (when the stomach is slow to empty), functional dyspepsia (an inability of the stomach wall to relax and accommodate food) and a condition known as SIBO, or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (in which excess bacteria live in a part of the intestinal tract where they don't belong).\n\nAdditionally, one might feel overly full or distended because there's too much gas in their gastrointestinal tract, because they are constipated or because they have aerophagia, or excessive air swallowing.\n\nIdentifying the cause of bloating matters because the treatment that offers relief will vary from person to person and is therefore not a \"one size fits all\" solution.\n\nMyth 2: You don't need a doctor or dietitian to help.\n\nMeeting with a gastroenterologist and a registered dietitian can help you get the most accurate diagnosis for your bloating, along with a tailored treatment plan. What's more, it can help you avoid nutritional deficiencies and rule out more serious problems.\n\n\"Though bloating can represent something as simple as lactose intolerance or mild constipation, it can be something as serious as a malignancy, whether gastrointestinal or gynecological in nature. And you're not going to know that by going online,\" Pashinsky said.\n\n\"I strongly feel that everyone should have a dietary assessment as part of their overall health care whether they are symptomatic or not,\" she added. \"Dietary causes are the most common contributors to gastrointestinal symptoms, and with the overwhelming amount of information available, people get caught up in restrictions that can diminish quality of life and lead to nutritional insufficiencies.\"\n\nFor example, self-diagnosis and treatment might lead someone to eliminate all vegetables, which can adversely affect intake of the essential nutrient folate, when in reality only a handful of veggies with specific types of fiber trigger their symptoms, Freuman explained. Additionally, people often eliminate all calcium-rich dairy foods, when only dairy foods high in the milk sugar lactose actually bother them. In this case, a lactose-free milk, for example, would help ensure adequate intake of calcium.\n\nMyth 3: Sodium causes 'bloating.'\n\n\"Excess sodium can cause fluid retention [not bloating per se] and can give a 'puffy' appearance, but more so in the face and extremities than in the abdomen,\" Freuman said.\n\nBloating in the gastrointestinal world generally refers to abdominal swelling that is related to either gas, food or stool excess in the intestinal system or the sensation of this, Pashinsky explained.\n\n\"It's that feeling of over-fullness and discomfort in the digestive tract, or it's a visible distention of your abdomen, which increases the size of your stomach,\" Freuman added.\n\nOn the flip side, fluid retention is related to sodium and water balance and involves the kidneys and blood vessels. \"It can lead to excessive soft tissue swelling, which can cause swollen ankles or indentation from socks, but this is not something that is primarily gastrointestinal in nature,\" Pashinsky said.\n\nThough it's true that eating a low-salt diet and drinking more water may help resolve fluid retention if your kidneys are working properly, this will do nothing for you if you are clinically bloated, Freuman explained.\n\nBeing precise with your terminology and giving examples of both alleviating an aggravating factors for symptoms and how these relate to eating and bowel function are important when talking with your doctor, as that will help determine next steps in testing and potential treatment options, Pashinksy said.\n\nFreuman added that \"If you use the term 'bloating,' your doctor might think you are suffering from acid reflux or constipation. But if you are actually retaining water, this might imply blood pressure issues or kidney issues or fluid retention, in which case you might need a low-sodium diet, increased intake of potassium or a diuretic.\"\n\nPut another way: If you are truly bloated from an underlying digestive issue and you read an article that says \"cut back on sodium,\" that won't be helpful.\n\n\"There's a smattering of random advice that's not particularly tailored to people and may not be useful, because you may not be talking about the same problem,\" Freuman said.\n\nMyth#4: Bloating is caused by a bacterial imbalance.\n\nOur gastrointestinal tracts are home to trillions of bacteria, which you can think of in three ways. The first is probiotic or beneficial bacteria, which may make vitamins and short-chain fatty acids that are good for us, Freuman explained. The second group of bacteria are called commensals, and they seem to neither help nor hurt us. The third is a group that is potentially pathogenic or harmful, like if a particular strain of E. coli is allowed to grow unchecked.\n\nAll of us host bacteria from these three categories. \"But there's this popular idea that if you feel bloated or have a lot of gas, that you are over-represented by the 'bad' disease-causing bacteria and have too little of the 'good' bacteria ... and that there is some sort of imbalance causing you to have excess gas or discomfort or constipation,\" Freuman said.\n\n\"This is an incredible oversimplification and not necessarily true.\"\n\nWhat this means is that the notion of adding more \"good\" bacteria in the form of a probiotic won't help your symptoms.\n\nIn fact, some find that a probiotic makes them more bloated, not less, Freuman said. That's because \"good\" bacteria can ferment nutrients just as much as the \"bad\" bacteria -- which means the \"good guys\" can produce plenty of gas in the GI tract.\n\nPashinsky added, \"I do not routinely recommend a probiotic for bloating because I feel our knowledge of the microbiome at this point is barely scratching the surface, and it will be a few years before we really have an decent understanding on how to manipulate it.\"\n\nMyth 5: Certain foods can eliminate bloating.\n\nDespite what you may find on an Internet search, there are no magic foods that will help alleviate bloating. \"Overall meal patterns and dietary patterns that address the specific cause of your bloating can help reduce the symptoms, but there's nothing magic about, say, asparagus that will cure a truly bloated belly,\" Freuman said.\n\nIn fact, adding foods can make your bloating worse, not better. \"If you are full of gas and you eat asparagus or celery, you might assume the gas will go away, but this is not necessarily the case,\" Freuman added. \"Some people find asparagus or celery gassy in and of itself.\"\n\nKeeping a food and symptom journal can help you determine whether there is something about your diet that is contributing to your symptoms.\n\n\"It's best to look at an overall pattern to see what can be contributing to the bloating, rather than seeking out salvation in some random superfood,\" Freuman said.\n\nMyth 6: Bloating is belly fat.\n\nBloating isn't belly fat. Belly fat is belly fat.\n\n\"People will say, 'I'm bloated,' but what they really mean is that they have gained belly fat,\" Freuman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGaining weight around your abdomen is common in women during menopause. \"Someone might say, 'I feel like I have a spare tire around my middle, and my clothes fit differently,' and they call it bloating, but I realize they are really talking about belly fat and weight gain, and the solution to that is weight loss,\" Freuman said.\n\nA calorie-restricted diet, rich in protein and fiber, along with increased amounts of exercise, can help.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/21/health/bloating-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-11-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "A healthier Thanksgiving in 8 traditional, simple, calorie-conscious courses", "text": "(CNN) Thanksgiving is a time for feasting, certainly not fasting or dieting.

What's more, depending on the pour, mixed drinks may contain more than one serving of alcohol (that is, more than 1.5 ounces of vodka or gin), which also boosts calories.\n\nAn 8-ounce White Russian can top 500 calories, thanks to Kahl\u00faa, vodka and heavy cream, but a 5-ounce glass of red wine has about 125 calories, or about a quarter of the amount. If you prefer the higher-calorie cocktails, limit yourself to one.\n\nRead More\n\nCarrots and hummus instead of cheese and crackers A couple of multigrain crackers with cheddar cheese has 134 calories -- not calorie overload, but compare that with two baby carrots with 2 tablespoons of hummus, which has only 62 calories, plus 2 grams of fiber. You can have double the portion for fewer calories if you choose crudit\u00e9 over cheese. If you prefer dips to hummus, try substituting Greek yogurt for sour cream to shave calories and boost protein. How to cook a Thanksgiving turkey Dark-meat turkey without skin instead of with skin Truth be told, dark-meat turkey is delicious and is typically juicier and more flavorful than white meat. Plus, dark meat delivers more zinc and iron than white meat. There's no need to forgo dark meat this Thanksgiving. But skip the skin to save some calories and saturated fat. Dark meat with skin is 175 calories per 3-ounce serving, and without skin is 147 calories. For portion control, keep your serving to 3 ounces, which is similar in size to a deck of cards or a computer mouse. Vegan mushroom gravy instead of traditional gravy Turkey may not seem like \"turkey\" without gravy, as the sauce gives a flavor upgrade to any dish. But making your gravy with mushrooms instead of meat drippings. can give your bird a savory \"umami\" flavor while saving a significant amount of calories and fat. Traditional gravy is 63 calories per quarter-cup, and vegan mushroom gravy is only 35 calories. And here's another bonus to mushroom gravy: Because it is meatless, it's suitable for vegan guests. Whatever gravy you choose, try using a tablespoon when serving yourself, instead of pouring from a gravy boat, to help control your portion size. How long can you eat those leftovers? Whole-grain stuffing with kale instead of traditional stuffing Stuffing is delicious, but using white bread as an ingredient is a missed nutritional opportunity, as it doesn't offer the fiber and vitamins that whole-grain bread does. Try a stuffing made with whole wheat bread, oats or quinoa to boost the nutrients. The New York Times' whole-grain stuffing with kale, figs, dates and hazelnuts has 7 grams of fiber and about 60 fewer calories per serving than a traditional stuffing. Traditional stuffing is about 420 calories per cup, while whole-grain stuffing with kale and dried fruit is 357 calories. Baked sweet potato instead of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows Sweet potatoes are nutritious and delicious and can help you achieve smooth, glowing skin, as they are loaded with vitamin A. However, when you add brown sugar, butter and marshmallows, you're pretty much eating dessert. One serving of candied sweet potato casserole with marshmallows packs 405 calories, 19 grams of fat and 32 grams of sugar. A whole baked sweet potato has only 130 calories and only 9 grams of natural sugar. You can even add some toasted marshmallows for an extra 30 calories. Where Thanksgiving calories hide -- and how to burn them off Low-fat green bean casserole instead of traditional green bean casserole Traditional green bean casserole is a Thanksgiving staple that is about 24 calories per cup, but the healthier eatingwell.com version with breadcrumbs instead of French fried onions has only 188 calories per cup. If you like the traditional green bean casserole recipe, you can use fresher, lower-fat ingredients that will improve the healthfulness of the dish and the flavor. Simply substitute the French fried onions with fresh onions (you can bake them after soaking them in buttermilk and coating with breadcrumbs and flour), and use low-fat condensed cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular version. You can also substitute low-fat milk (like 1%) for whole milk, which saves calories and saturated fat. Pumpkin pie instead of pecan pie There's no need to skip dessert, but by choosing pumpkin pie over pecan pie, you can save over 200 calories. Pecan pie is about 541 calories per slice, and pumpkin is 323 calories. Apple pie is another lower-calorie choice compared with pecan, at 363 calories per slice. If you can't resist pecan pie (and who could blame you), take a thin slice, or go crustless and eat only the filling. And hold off on the whipped cream!

Hopefully, you won't miss anything from your 2,546-calorie traditional feast as you enjoy a traditional, simple, delicious 1,367-calorie Thanksgiving dinner.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/20/health/healthy-thanksgiving-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-11-20T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Which alcoholic beverages are more diet-friendly?", "text": "(CNN) I often tell people to steer clear of alcoholic beverages when trying to lose weight. After all, they don't exactly provide nutritious calories, and consuming them can make it increasingly more challenging to lose weight. But that doesn't stop people from asking me, \"what is the best drink to have on a diet?\"\n\nClearly, some alcoholic beverages are more waistline-friendly than others. So the short answer is: If you're looking to shed pounds, some of your lowest-calorie bets are a shot of spirits (for example, a 1.5-ounce shot of vodka, gin, rum, whiskey or tequila contains an average of 97 calories), a glass of champagne (about 84 calories per 4 ounces); a glass of dry wine (approximately 120 to 125 calories per 5 ounces) or a traditional martini, with an average of 124 calories for a 2.5-ounce serving. A light beer (approximately 100 calories) or a glass of reduced-calorie wine (about 90 to 100 calories) are other lower-calorie options.\n\nBut if you want to know why some alcoholic beverages contain more calories than others, read on.\n\nPure alcohol contains 7 calories per gram -- that's less than a gram of fat, which has 9 calories, but more than protein and carbs, which have 4 calories per gram each -- but other variables of your drink influence the calorie count. The amount of alcohol, the total volume of a beverage, the amount of carbohydrates and sugars and mixers all play a role.\n\nGenerally speaking, the biggest difference in calories in beverages comes from the alcohol content, but the presence of carbohydrates in alcoholic beverages also contributes largely to its calories, according to Dwayne Bershaw, who teaches winemaking classes in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University.\n\nRead More\n\nAny carbohydrates in wine consist of small amounts of sugar, which may either be left over from the original grape sugar after most of it ferments into alcohol or added from grape juice or some other source, in order to balance the acidity of the wine. Unless we're talking about a dessert wine, this amount of sugar is generally small and does not contribute a significant amount of calories to wine. No amount of alcohol is good for your overall health, global study says Beer is made from grain, which stores carbohydrates in the form of starch -- specifically large, branched sugar molecules, which are chopped into pieces by naturally occurring enzymes in malted barley during the brewing process. The smallest sugar pieces are converted to alcohol by yeast, but some larger pieces remain that cannot be broken down by yeast, according to Bershaw. These remaining carbohydrates contribute to the overall calorie count for most beers. Generally, beer has more calories than wine, but the calorie difference in the two primarily comes from the leftover carbohydrates in beer, as the sugar content for most wines is fairly low. Low-calorie beers have an additional enzyme added during the brewing or fermentation process, and it breaks down all of the starch molecules into simple sugars so there are no remaining carbohydrates. These beers also have a relatively low alcohol content to keep the total calorie count quite low, according to Bershaw. And generally, spirits -- including vodka, tequila, rum and gin -- do not contain any carbohydrates or sugars. Some producers may add small amounts of sugar to combat any perceived bitterness, according to Bershaw, but like wine, this small amount would not bump the calorie count much. Though they have higher alcohol by volume (up to 40% or more), the volume of a standard shot is small (1.5 ounces), making them a relatively lower-calorie option -- that is, as long as you can stick to one shot or mix it with a zero-calorie beverage, like a diet cola, soda water or seltzer.

Other ingredients -- including mixers, tonic water, juice, soda, syrups, cream and coconut -- all pack sugar and fat calories on top of alcohol and should be consumed with caution, explained Ginger Hultin, a registered dietitian, spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and author of the blog ChampagneNutrition. \"Margaritas and pina coladas can have close to 500 calories per drink, depending on the size and how it's made, and could be a real challenge for anyone with a weight loss goal,\" Hultin added.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/09/health/alcohol-diet-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-11-09T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Can coffee really sober you up?", "text": "(CNN) You're out late at night and you've had one too many drinks. You're feeling a bit inebriated, and you're wondering if a cup of coffee can help. Many of us have been there.\n\nWell, here's the lowdown: While a cup of joe or shot of espresso can help to perk you up, it's not going to help sober you up. In fact, in some situations, the combination of caffeine and alcohol could be potentially harmful.\n\n\"I call it the 'perfect storm,' \" said Dr. Mary Claire O'Brien, senior associate dean for health care education at the Wake Forest School of Medicine, who has researched the interactions between caffeine and alcohol, including its effects on injury risk.\n\nHow alcohol and caffeine are metabolized\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant, so it can make you more alert and possibly improve your performance to some extent, according to Dr. Robert Swift, associate director of the Brown University Center for Alcohol and Addition Studies. Specifically, caffeine interferes with the action of a chemical known as adenosine. \"Adenosine tends to be sedative ... and one of the signals to fall asleep is that adenosine builds up in the brain,\" Swift said. By blocking the action of adenosine, caffeine has the ability to make you feel less tired, Swift explained.\n\nInterestingly, alcohol can trigger the release of dopamine, which results in a stimulant effect when you first start drinking, though this does not necessarily mean you are any less impaired from alcohol, according to Swift.\n\nAlcohol's sedative effects tend to kick in after blood alcohol levels peak and then start to fall. Specifically, alcohol promotes the release of the brain chemical GABA, which produces sedation, Swift explained. Alcohol also blocks the action of glutamate, a brain chemical that stimulates nerve cells, and this blockade can also produce sedation. During this time, you might feel tired, and in need of a pick-me-up.\n\nAlcohol and caffeine: A potentially dangerous combination\n\nConsuming caffeine might make you feel less sleepy when drinking alcohol, but it will not accelerate alcohol metabolism or ameliorate its effects, experts say. Mixing the two is also a practice that the US Dietary Guidelines cautions against\n\nA major concern when seeking out coffee or any source of caffeine in an effort to feel awake after a few drinks, is that by making you feel less tired, you may think you are less inebriated than you actually are.\n\n\"Even if someone feels like the caffeine causes them to feel more awake and less sluggish, they still need to be aware that the alcohol is still metabolizing in the same way and on the same timeframe as if they haven't had any caffeine ... which means that its effects can still be potentially dangerous,\" said Melissa Majumdar, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\n\"Someone may think, 'I can drive now' ... they see a car stop suddenly, and they have to put their foot on the brake quickly, but reaction time could be slow,\" Swift said. \"What you feel is [linked to] a different part of your brain that is the motor system that controls reaction time.\"\n\n\"Your blood alcohol concentration won't be reversed by caffeine,\" Swift added. That means people feel less tired from alcohol when they drink coffee, \"but they are not any less impaired,\" Swift explained.\n\nIn one study involving close to 130 adult drinkers, alcohol negatively affected reaction time and resulted in more crashes during a simulated driving test, but drinking caffeinated beer didn't improve people's ability to drive\n\nIn addition to the fact that consuming caffeine while drinking won't make you any sharper behind the wheel, there also is no evidence that consuming caffeine while drinking would improve your judgment in social situations, according to Swift.\n\nWhat's more, by making you feel less tired or sedated, you may be inclined to consume more alcohol than you otherwise would. \"If you take caffeine with your alcohol, people drink more,\" Swift said. \"The usual signal where people would say 'I've had enough' is no longer there.\"\n\n\"Caffeine permits you to stay awake longer than you would have otherwise -- and therefore drink for a longer amount of time,\" O'Brien added. \"I had the experience of taking care of a young man who was extremely intoxicated, and almost on a ventilator ... he said had been drinking Red Bull and J\u00e4germeister. When I asked why he was mixing alcohol and caffeine, he said, 'So I can stay drunk longer,' \" O'Brien said.\n\nThe marketing and sale of premixed beverages containing alcohol and caffeine has been particularly concerning among experts. But there has been a positive outcome: O'Brien's research examining injury associated with these caffeinated malt beverages (dubbed \"AEDs, or \"alcoholic energy drinks\") contributed to the successful removal of these beverages from the market in 2010.\n\n\"The FDA put the kibosh on that, because of the negative public health implications,\" Swift said.\n\nStrategies for sobering up\n\nExperts say the only way to sober up is to let time pass. The specific time it will take for alcohol to leave your system depends on the individual, but on average, people metabolize about one drink per hour. \"If you've had five drinks, it would take about five hours to get the alcohol totally out of your system,\" Swift said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBut an even better strategy is to prevent intoxication in the first place. Experts say drinking with food in your stomach can slow the rise of alcohol in your bloodstream, which can make you less impaired than if you drank on an empty stomach.\n\nAlternating alcoholic beverages with seltzer or water is another helpful strategy. It won't slow the absorption of alcohol in the body or make you less inebriated, but \"water will help keep one hydrated ... and can potentially decrease the amount of alcohol someone drinks,\" Majumdar said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/26/health/coffee-sober-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-10-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Eggs reduce heart disease risk, study says", "text": "(CNN) Eating an egg a day may lower your risk of cardiovascular disease, a study of more than 400,000 adults in China suggests.\n\nDaily egg eaters had an 18% lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, which manifests as heart attacks and strokes, compared with adults who avoided eggs, according to the research published Monday in the journal Heart.\n\nCommonly called heart disease, cardiovascular disease includes heart failure, arrhythmias and heart valve problems in addition to strokes and attacks. Raised blood pressure, carrying too much weight or obesity, and elevated blood sugar all contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease, which is triggered by unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, smoking and harmful use of alcohol.\n\n'Controversial' nutrition source\n\nIn the past, doctors sometimes warned patients to avoid eating too many eggs\n\nThough eggs contain high-quality protein and other positive nutritional components, they also have high amounts of cholesterol, which was thought might be harmful, explained Canqing Yu , a co-author of the study and an associate professor in the Peking University School of Public Health in Beijing.\n\nYet \"existing studies on the association between egg and cardiovascular diseases are controversial due to small sample size and limited information,\" Yu wrote in an email. Past studies have provided only limited evidence from the Chinese population, \"which have huge differences in dietary habits, lifestyle behaviors and diseases patterns,\" Yu said.\n\nThese are among the reasons why he and his colleagues decided to investigate the relationship between eating eggs and cardiovascular disease.\n\nTo begin, they used information from an ongoing study of half a million adults living in 10 regions of China. They concentrated on 416,213 participants who'd never been diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes.\n\nSlightly more than 13% of these adults, ranging in age from 30 to 79, said they ate about an egg a day while just over 9% reported never or very rarely enjoying an egg. Nearly all the participants ate chicken, not duck, eggs, Yu noted.\n\nOver nearly nine years, the research team tracked this select group. They focused on major coronary events, such as heart attacks and strokes , including hemorrhagic strokes -- when a blood vessel bursts in the brain due, usually, to uncontrolled high blood pressure -- and ischemic strokes -- when a blood vessel feeding the brain becomes blocked, usually by a blood clot.\n\n\"Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of deaths in China, which accounted for half of the total mortality,\" Yu said. \"Stroke, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, is the first cause of premature death, followed by ischemic heart disease.\"\n\nDuring follow-up, 9,985 people died of cardiovascular disease, and an additional 5,103 major coronary events occurred. Nearly 84,000 other participants were diagnosed with heart disease in this time period.\n\nAnalyzing the data, the researchers found that eating about an egg a day related to a lower risk of heart disease compared with not eating eggs.\n\nIn fact, participants who ate up to one egg daily had a 26% lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is more common in China than in the United States or other high-income countries. Additionally, the egg eaters had a 28% lower risk of dying from this type of stroke.\n\nFinally, egg eaters also enjoyed a 12% reduced risk of ischemic heart disease, which is diagnosed in those who show the early signs of gridlocked blood flow to the brain.\n\nBased on the results, Yu said, eating eggs in moderation -- less than one a day -- is associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Even more, the new research is \"by far the most powerful project to detect such an effect,\" he said.\n\nOn the downside, the research team collected only \"crude information\" about egg consumption from participants, and this prevented them from estimating effects \"more precisely,\" Yu said. \"We should [also] be cautious when interpreting our results in a context of different dietary and lifestyle characteristics from China.\"\n\nPart of a healthy diet\n\nCaroline Richard, an assistant professor of agricultural life and environmental sciences at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, said the new study is simply observational and so cannot show a direct cause and effect between eating eggs and risk of heart disease.\n\n\"Saying that, this is a very large study, and that in itself is a strength, and the researchers have done the best possible job to control for other factors,\" said Richard, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHer own systematic review of studies showed that when participants are provided with between six and 12 eggs a week, no change occurs in major cardiovascular risk factors, including higher rates of blood sugar, inflammation and cholesterol.\n\n\"Several studies in our review observed a positive effect of egg consumption on HDL cholesterol,\" or \"good\" cholesterol, she added.\n\nThe new study, then, \"delivers a similar message\" that \"egg consumption does not increase the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease,\" Richard said.\n\nSome studies have suggested that consuming eggs increases the risk of diabetes, she said.\n\n\"In this study however, they didn't assess the risk of developing diabetes, which may be because diabetes is a newer disease in the Chinese population and there is not good documentation of who has it,\" Richard said. Still, she noted, \"this will be very important data for helping develop dietary prevention guidelines in China.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nCardiovascular disease, which takes the lives of 17.7 million people every year, is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide, according to the World Health Organization .

New research suggests that cutting calories by 15% for two years can slow the metabolic process that leads to aging and protect against age-related diseases.\n\nAfter just one year on a reduced-calorie diet, study participants saw their metabolic rates drop significantly. The lowered rate continued into the second year and led to an overall decrease in oxidative stress, a process that has been tied to diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and other age-related conditions.\n\n\"Reducing calorie intake provides health benefits to all people regardless of their current health status,\" said Leanne M. Redman, lead author of the study and an associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University.\n\nAnimal studies have shown that restricting calories by 25% can extend life. The new CALERIE (Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy) study was designed by Redman, her colleagues and the National Institute on Aging to answer a simple question: Would the same be true in humans?\n\nAging biomarkers\n\nDuring the first phase, teams of researchers ran small-scale pilot experiments to answer a variety of questions including, what kind of calorie restriction could study participants actually stick to? To this end, some of the pilot studies tested a diet-only calorie reduction, others tested exercise only, and still others tested half-diet, half-exercise.\n\nAnother question posed by the researchers: What level of calorie restrictions would have an impact on biomarkers of aging?\n\nAging biomarkers are simple biological measurements that differentiate longer-lived people -- those who celebrate birthdays into their 90s and 100s -- from people who live the average life expectancy, Redman said.\n\n\"We know that longer-lived individuals are able to sustain lower blood sugar levels and lower levels of insulin and have lower core body temperature levels in comparison to people who don't live as long as them,\" she said.\n\nAfter the pilot studies, the National Institute on Aging committed to funding larger phase two CALERIE studies at three universities: Pennington in Baton Rouge, Washington University in St. Louis and Tufts University in Boston.\n\nAt Pennington, Redman and her colleagues focused on reducing calories by 25% through diet alone. Women between 25 and 45 and men between 25 and 50 were recruited; about half were normal weight and the other half overweight but not obese. Throughout the study, participants ate what they liked, yet they also took vitamins and supplements to ensure that their diets were \"nutritionally adequate,\" Redman said.\n\nEach participant was also given a scale. Instead of calculating daily calories and slashing them by 25%, weight loss was used to estimate the total reduction in calories for each participant over time.\n\nHowever, the participants did not hit the 25% reduction as anticipated, Redman said: \"People achieved 15% calorie restriction, actual, over the two years.\" No matter. The results from this lesser calorie restriction amount were \"pretty remarkable,\" she said.\n\nFor example, participants lost an average of about 20 pounds each by the end of the first year and maintained that loss during the second year.\n\n\"The calorie-restrictive diet also caused a reduction in sleeping metabolic rate by about 10%,\" Redman said. This remained true after one year, when weight loss peaked, and after two years, when weight remained constant.\n\nA slowed metabolism means the body has become more efficient in using fuel -- whether from food or oxygen -- to derive energy.\n\n\"It's important because every time we generate energy in the body, we generate byproducts,\" Redman said. These byproducts of normal metabolism, also called oxygen radicals, accumulate in the body and over time cause damage to cells and organs, she explained. And this damage is \"what has been linked to a shortened lifespan,\" she said.\n\nNot only did calorie restriction slow the metabolism of participants, lower levels of oxidative damage were seen when measured by a compound in urine. Calorie restriction, then, mimicked some of the healthy aging signposts seen in long-lived individuals, Redman said.\n\n'Breakthrough'\n\nThe \"big breakthrough\" with this study, said biologist John R. Speakman of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, is that it is the first randomized controlled trial of calorie restriction in humans.\n\nRandomized, controlled trials, in which participants are divided by chance into groups to compare interventions, are considered more valuable to scientists than other types of experiments. Speakman, who did not participate in the research but he served on the data safety and monitoring board for the CALERIE project, explained that all previous studies of calorie restriction in humans have been on a voluntary basis.\n\n\"It has been known since the 1930s that calorie restriction reduces the rate of aging and extends lifespan in rodents,\" Speakman said. Since then, studies in different animals show the same general pattern -- with some exceptions. \"For example, it doesn't work in houseflies,\" he said. \"Plus, the monkey literature is a bit confusing.\"\n\nFor this reason, the new study's \"big contribution\" is that participants showed two key changes previously observed in calorie-restricted rodents: lowered metabolic rate and reduced production of radical oxygen species, Speakman said.\n\nThat said, the level of calorie restriction achieved in the new study was \"rather modest compared to that used in rodents and other animals,\" he said. \"This really shows the difficulties in doing calorie restriction work on humans.\" However, a strength of the new research is that it \"included extensive measurements of the individual responses.\"\n\nExactly how calorie restriction prevents aging, Speakman said \"is the million-dollar question.\" The research supports two theories of longer life: the \"rate of living\" (lower metabolism) and reduced oxidative damage.\n\nHowever, the study shows a correlation only, he said, \"so we can't infer that these changes are causally linked to reduced aging. Nevertheless it is a step forwards to indicate that these two ideas are not rejected by the current research.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nGoing forward, Redman wants to reconvene the study participants to see whether they're maintaining calorie restrictions and lowered metabolic rates. She also wants to study a group of people from early in their lives until death so she can see the possible long-term results of restricted calorie intake.\n\nIt's not only the diet, she repeated.\n\nIt's true that the people who see more sunrises than most of us eat less -- and more healthy -- calories than in a Western diet, Redman said. \"But what's important is they're living longer and they're free of chronic disease.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/22/health/calorie-restriction-longer-life-study/index.html", "published": "2018-03-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How to detox from a sodium habit you may not know you have", "text": "Story highlights Look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods\n\nMore than 70% of sodium in an average American diet comes in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods\n\n(CNN) We've covered the many health reasons to curb your salt intake. But let's talk about how, especially when it's hidden in many of the foods we love.\n\nWhen cutting back on sodium, it's important to start slowly, as going cold turkey can shock your taste buds. \"If you try to make chicken soup with no salt, you will notice the difference,\" said Sonya Angelone, a registered dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular nutrition and is the media spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Instead, start with half of the amount of salt you would typically use.\n\nYou can also look for low- or reduced-sodium versions of your favorite foods, or make your own versions, like homemade spaghetti sauce. For example, canned tomato sauce can have 1,000 milligrams of sodium per serving. \"But canned tomatoes have about 300 milligrams, and tomato paste has very little sodium -- so you can just add water or low-sodium chicken broth\" to make a sauce, Angelone said.\n\nUsing herbs and spices can help bring out flavor in foods without salt. Spice blends without salt can come in handy during cooking. You might use a Mexican blend with cumin, chili pepper and smoked paprika for chili, while blends containing rosemary, thyme and oregano might be well suited for Italian dishes, Angelone explained.\n\nWhen dining out, ask for steamed vegetables and fish, and skip the sauces. And when food shopping, compare the sodium values of similar foods. \"Some rolls can have 400 milligrams; other ones can have 200,\" Angelone said. Breads and rolls are top sources of sodium in the US diet, according to the American Heart Association , along with cold cuts and cured meats, pizza, soup, sandwiches and poultry.\n\nRead More\n\nBe sure to look for hidden sources of sodium. Code words for sodium on food labels include fleur de sel, monosodium glutamate and disodium guanylate. And don't be fooled by different forms of salt, which may appear healthier than they are. \"Himalyan pink salt or kosher salt or sea salt all have the same amount of sodium,\" Angelone said. And reduce the amount of processed food you eat. Salt vs. sodium and the problem with processed foods Sodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in foods and enters our diets through processed foods. White salt crystals are technically a combination of sodium and chloride. In fact, by weight, salt is about 40% sodium and 60% chloride. If you sprinkle a teaspoon of salt on your food regularly, cutting it out will eliminate a day's worth of sodium. But that's just skimming sodium's surface, because only 11% of the sodium in our diets comes from the salt shaker, which we may grab during cooking or eating. About 15% of sodium in a typical American diet occurs naturally in foods. But the rest -- more than 70% -- comes from sodium in packaged, prepared and restaurant foods, including canned soups, frozen foods and lunch meats. Some of top 25 foods that add the most sodium to your diet include pizza, cold cuts, burritos, soup, cheese, milk, eggs, rice and cake. Manufacturers add sodium to help preserve food and enhance the flavor and texture. But they are contributing to our increasingly high sodium intake. If less sodium is added to foods during processing, it's much easier for consumers to cut back. To help Americans achieve recommended sodium levels, the Food and Drug Administration recently proposed voluntary sodium reformulation targets for processed foods. Potassium-rich foods: An important part of a salt detox In addition to limiting sodium, experts say that focusing on increasing potassium-rich foods is an important part of a salt detox. \"Sodium stiffens your arteries ... but potassium does the opposite,\" Angelone said. To maximize your salt detox, Angelone recommends limiting overly processed foods that contain a lot of sodium and replacing them with more potassium-rich produce, as well as unsalted nuts, beans and legumes. Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \"By eating less salty, processed foods and more simple fresh foods, you are going to automatically consume less sodium and more potassium,\" she said. Finally, when you choose to consume salty snacks and foods, be sure to savor them. \"If you are going to have salt, have it in something that really matters. ... It makes food taste good, but make sure it really counts,\" Angelone said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/26/health/salt-detox-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-04-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "One-month sugar detox: A nutritionist explains how and why", "text": "(CNN) If you've read about the latest wellness trends, you may have entertained the idea of a diet detox.\n\nBut whether you've considered juicing, fasting or cleansing in an effort to lose weight or improve your well-being, you're probably aware that drastically cutting out foods is not effective as a long-term lifestyle approach to healthy eating.\n\nIn fact, strict detoxing can cause issues including fatigue, dizziness and low blood sugar.\n\nBut there is one kind of sustainable detox that is worthwhile, according to some experts. Reducing sugar in your diet can help you drop pounds, improve your health and even give you more radiant skin.\n\n\"Sugar makes you fat, ugly and old,\" said Brooke Alpert, a registered dietitian and co-author of \"The Sugar Detox: Lose the Sugar, Lose the Weight -- Look and Feel Great.\" \"What we've discovered in the last couple of years is that sugar is keeping us overweight. It's also a leading cause of heart disease; it negatively affects skin, and it leads to premature aging.\"\n\nSugar addiction\n\nHere's more bad news: We can't stop consuming sugar. \"People have a real dependency -- a real addiction to sugar,\" Alpert said. \"We have sugar, we feel good from it, we get (the feeling of) an upper, and then we crash and need to reach for more.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED How to tame a sweet tooth Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How to tame a sweet tooth 01:05\n\nAbout 10% of the US population are true sugar addicts, according to Robert Lustig, professor of pediatrics and member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. What's more, research suggests that sugar induces rewards and cravings that are similar in magnitude to those induced by addictive drugs.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns is the amount of added sugars in our diets, which are often hidden in foods. Although ice cream cake is an obvious source of sugar, other foods that may not even taste sweet -- such as salad dressings, tomato sauces and breads -- can be loaded with the white stuff.\n\n\"People don't realize that seemingly healthy foods are loaded with sugar -- and so we're basically eating sugar all day long, from morning till night,\" Alpert said.\n\nHow to sugar detox: Going cold turkey for three days\n\nThe good news is that even if you're not a true sugar \"addict,\" by eliminating sugar from your diet, you can quickly lose unwanted pounds, feel better and have a more radiant appearance.\n\n\"There is no one person who wouldn't benefit by eliminating added sugars from their diets,\" Lustig said.\n\nChildren can benefit, too. Lustig's research revealed that when obese children eliminated added sugars from their diets for just nine days, every aspect of their metabolic health improved -- despite no changes in body weight or total calories consumed.\n\nBut going cold turkey is what works best, at least in the beginning.\n\n\"Early on in my practice, when I would notice that people had real addiction to sugar, we'd start trying to wean them of sugar or limit their intake or eat in moderation ... but the word 'moderation' is so clich\u00e9d and not effective,\" Alpert said. \"It was just ineffective to ask people to eat less of something when they're struggling with this bad habit. You wouldn't ask an alcoholic to just drink two beers.\n\n\"What was so successful in getting my clients to kick their sugar habit was to go cold turkey. When they would go cold turkey, I wasn't their favorite person -- but the number one positive effect was that it recalibrated their palate,\" she said. \"They could now taste natural sugars in fruits, vegetables and dairy that they used to be so dulled to.\"\n\nSo for the first three days on a sugar detox, Alpert recommends no added sugars -- but also no fruits, no starchy vegetables (such as corn, peas, sweet potatoes and butternut squash), no dairy, no grains and no alcohol. \"You're basically eating protein, vegetables and healthy fats.\"\n\nFor example, breakfast can include three eggs, any style; lunch can include up to 6 ounces of poultry, fish or tofu and a green salad, and dinner is basically a larger version of lunch, though steamed vegetables such as broccoli, kale and spinach can be eaten in place of salad. Snacks include an ounce of nuts and sliced peppers with hummus. Beverages include water, unsweetened tea and black coffee.\n\nThough they don't contribute calories, artificial sweeteners are not allowed on the plan, either. \"These little pretty colored packets pack such a punch of sweetness, and that's how our palates get dulled and immune and less reactive to what sweetness really is,\" Alpert said.\n\nConsuming artificial sweeteners causes \"you not only (to) store more fat,\" Lustig explained, \"you also end up overeating later on to compensate for the increased energy storage.\"\n\nHow to sugar detox: When an apple tastes like candy\n\nOnce the first three days of the sugar detox are completed, you can add an apple.\n\n\"By the fourth day, an apple tastes like candy,\" Alpert said. \"The onions are sweet! Almonds are sweet! Once you take sugar away from your diet cold turkey, your palate recalibrates, and you start tasting natural sugars again.\"\n\nStarting with day four, you can add one apple and one dairy food each day. Dairy, such as yogurt or cheese, should be full-fat and unsweetened. \"Fat, fiber and protein slow the absorption of sugar, so taking out fat from dairy will make you absorb sugar faster,\" Alpert said.\n\nYou can also add some higher-sugar vegetables such as carrots and snow peas, as well as a daily serving of high-fiber crackers. Three glasses of red wine in that first week can be added, too.\n\nDuring week two, you can add a serving of antioxidant-rich berries and an extra serving of dairy. You can also add back starchy vegetables such as yams and winter squash.\n\nFor week three, you can add grains such as barley, quinoa and oatmeal, and even some more fruit including grapes and clementines. You can also have another glass of red wine during the week and an ounce of dark chocolate each day.\n\n\"Week three should be quite livable,\" Alpert said.\n\nWeek four is the home stretch, when you can enjoy two starches per day, including bread and rice, in addition to high-fiber crackers. Wine goes up to five glasses per week.\n\n\"You can have a sandwich in week four, which just makes things easier,\" Alpert said. \"I want people living. Week four is the way to do it.\"\n\nWeek four defines the maintenance part of the plan -- though intentional indulgences are allowed, such as ice cream or a piece of cake at a birthday party. \"Because the addictive behavior is gone, having ice cream once or twice will not send you back to square one,\" Alpert said. Additionally, no fruit is off-limits once you've completed the 31 days.\n\n\"The whole purpose is to give people control and ownership and a place for these foods in our life,\" Alpert said.\n\n\n\nBenefits and cautions with slashing sugar\n\nDetoxing from sugar can help you lose weight quickly. \"We had over 80 testers from all over the country, and they lost anywhere between 5 to 20 pounds during the 31 days, depending on their weight or sugar addiction,\" Alpert said. \"Many also noticed that a lot of the weight was lost from their midsection. Belts got looser!\"\n\nParticipants also reported brighter eyes, clearer skin and fewer dark circles. They also had more energy and fewer mood swings.\n\nPhotos: Natural sweeteners Photos: Natural sweeteners Although maple syrup contains some vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, the amounts in a typical serving are quite small.

She has been on the plan for approximately two years.\n\n\"I thought I was educated on weight loss, but like many, I was miseducated, and by reducing fat, I was really just adding sugar. With the elimination of sugar, including artificial sweeteners, it is incredible how sweet foods tastes.\"\n\nDiane added back some healthy fats into her diet, which keeps her feeling satisfied. And her sugar cravings disappeared. \"This is probably the longest I have remained on a plan, and I don't feel like this will change. It just feels natural and normal.\"\n\nThere are challenges and medical considerations before starting, though. Since the first few days of a sugar detox can be challenging, it's important to pick three days during which your schedule will be supportive.\n\n\"Depending on how intense your addiction is, you can experience withdrawal symptoms, such as brain fog, crankiness and fatigue,\" Alpert said. Lustig found that the children in his study experienced anxiety and irritability during the first five days of eliminating sugar and caffeine, though it eventually subsided.\n\n\"If you feel bad, stop and have a piece of fruit.

If you're searching on the Internet, chances are you've stumbled on something called the \"military diet.\"\n\nIt's also known as the Navy diet, the Army diet and sometimes the ice cream diet, because in addition to hot dogs and tuna fish, you get to eat ice cream on all three days of the program.\n\nSmells fishy, right? Well, hold your nose. It's about to get really stinky.\n\nWhat is the military diet?\n\nThe military diet is a variation of the ever-popular three-day diet, a crash plan of \"fill-in-the-blank\" foods to eat if you want to lose weight fast. These diets typically claim that you can lose about 10 pounds in three days to a week if you follow their blueprint to the letter. The meal plans are usually extremely basic and calorie-restrictive, because let's face it, that's how you lose weight.\n\nBut are these diets healthy? Will the weight stay off?\n\n\"With this type of low-calorie, lower-carbohydrate diet, you are losing mostly water and potentially some muscle,\" said registered dietitian Elaine Magee , author of \"Tell Me What to Eat If I Have Diabetes.\" \"Water weight drops quickly as the body's glycogen stores decline, which happens when you restrict carbs and calories. Weight will come back when you begin to eat normally again.\"\n\nCould it be that the military diet is different? Here's a breakdown of what's prescribed on days one to three of the military diet, with calories calculated via the US Department of Agriculture's calorie-calculating tool, Supertracker.\n\nBreakfast is a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea, one slice of toast with 2 tablespoons of peanut butter and half a grapefruit. That's 308 calories.\n\nLunch is another cup of coffee or tea, a bare-bones slice of toast (whole-wheat is best, they rightly say) and a half-cup of tuna. This meal is tiny, only 139 calories.\n\nDinner is 3 ounces of any meat (that's about the size of a playing card), a cup of green beans, half of a banana and a small apple (not a large apple, even though the calorie difference is minuscule), but wait: You get a whole cup of vanilla ice cream! If you choose steak instead of a lean chicken breast as your entree, this meal equals 619 calories.\n\nBut even with the steak and the cup of full-fat ice cream, the day adds up to a mere 1,066 calories. No snacks allowed.\n\n\"If you're used to eating 2,000 to 2,500 calories a day, such a drastic drop will be hard to do,\" said registered dietitian Lisa Drayer , who writes about nutrition for CNN. \"You're going to be tired and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. It will be hard to exercise, and I would think you'll be quite hungry as well.\"\n\nHere's day two's repast. It adds up to only 1,193 calories, even if you pick some higher-fat options.\n\nBreakfast is another dry piece of toast, one egg cooked however you like and half of a banana. Let's say you fry your egg in oil. That's 223 calories.\n\nLunch is a hard-boiled egg, five saltine crackers and a cup of cottage cheese. If you choose full-fat cottage cheese, the total is 340 calories.\n\nDinner is half of a banana, a half-cup of carrots, a full cup of broccoli, two hot dogs (that's right!) and another treat: a half-cup of vanilla ice cream. The meal totals 630 calories (if you eat a full-fat pork or beef dog).\n\nHow does this fare fair?\n\n\"I never recommend hot dogs or any processed meats,\" Drayer said, \"because they are associated with a higher risk for cancer .\"\n\n\"Ice cream is not a good use of the meager calories,\" she added. \"You could have 3 cups of salad and only eat 100 calories, or other nutritious foods that will be satisfying and hold back the hunger.\"\n\nDay three is the most restrictive, only 762 calories.\n\nBreakfast is a slice of cheddar cheese with five saltines and a small apple. That's 232 calories.\n\nLunch is grim: one dry slice of toast and an egg. Even if you fry the egg in oil again, that's a total of 170 calories.\n\nDinner is 460 calories and a stomach-turning combination of half a banana, a full cup of tuna and another cup of ice cream. Maybe they think that by now, you're so hungry, you'll be willing to eat those foods together.\n\nThe websites promoting the military diet say that eating certain food combinations will boost your metabolism.\n\n\"There is no truth behind claims that the food combinations in the first few days will increase your metabolism and burn fat,\" Magee said.\n\n\"There's no research I know of behind those claims,\" Drayer agreed.\n\nAnd what about the rest of the week?\n\nYou round out your week by eating what you like, so long as it's less than 1,500 calories a day. Then you can start on the three-day restrictions again.\n\nBest of all, no exercise -- zero, zip, nada -- is said to be needed on this diet.\n\n\"Yet another fad diet that won't lead to healthy or sustainable weight loss!\" Magee said with passion, adding that exercise is \"key to lasting weight loss.\"\n\nShe also feels there are potential physical and emotional ramifications to diets that restrict and deprive you to this extent.\n\n\"It can lead to weight cycling, a quick loss and regain of weight, that can weaken your immune system, mess with your metabolic rate and increase the risk of other health problems, such as gallstones and heart trouble,\" Magee said.\n\nWhy is it called the military diet?\n\narticles, bloggers, Why would such a fad diet be associated with the military? According to various YouTubers and message board posts , it was designed by nutritionists in the US military to drop pounds off recruits who otherwise wouldn't measure up.\n\n\"What? In my 30 years working with the military, I've never heard of it,\" said certified nutrition specialist Patricia Deuster , professor at the Uniformed Services University and author of the first US Navy SEAL Nutrition guide.\n\n\"We did not develop this. We do not use it. It has absolutely no resemblance to the real military diet. Even our rations are healthier and more nutritionally sound,\" Deuster said. \"It looks like they just took the name 'military' and added it to the diet and capitalized on it.\"\n\n\"The Birmingham Hospital Diet did not originate with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and we do not support or recommend it,\" university public relations manager Bob Shepard said. \"This diet has absolutely no connection to UAB Hospital other than the often repeated but false Internet rumors.\"\n\nOh?\n\n\"It is unfortunate our name has been associated with this diet,\" the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement. \"We have never endorsed this meal plan, and it does not meet the standards for what we would consider a healthy diet for heart health or overall well-being.\"\n\nAnd?\n\n\"The American Heart Association is not -- and never has been -- associated with this diet.\"\n\n\"This didn't come from us, despite the use of the word Kaiser. Kaiser Permanente supports a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\"\n\n\"None of these diets, including the three-day diet, was developed at or ever associated with Mayo Clinic,\" said Dr. Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program and medical editor of the real Mayo Clinic Diet. \"It is likely the originators tried to capitalize on Mayo Clinic's brand recognition as a way of promoting these diets.\"\n\nWhere did this diet come from?\n\nIf you search the Internet for the military diet, you'll probably end up on the top result: themilitarydiet.com . There, you'll find the detailed diet, with pictures and tips on how to make it work for you. There are substitutions, frequently asked questions, a blog, a calorie count, a link to like them on Facebook and a review that fights back against nutritionists who debunk the diet.\n\nOh, and there are lots of ads.\n\nBut nowhere on the page is there an author, an expert, a nutritional guru. No one takes ownership of this information or gives you any credentials to prove their expertise.\n\n\"That's a red flag,\" Drayer said. \"Any helpful diet plan should be created or supported by a credible person or resource or organization. If something is out there without any author or inventor, anyone can say anything and not know how the body works.\"\n\nTrying to track down the owners of three of the most popular military diet sites proved to be a dead end. Emails and calls to listed numbers got no responses.\n\nHow diet misinformation spreads\n\n\"Due to our democratic process, we have a wide-open information environment in the US,\" said Brian Southwell, editor of a new book on fake news called \" Misinformation and Mass Audiences .\" \"There's no careful censoring of false information.\"\n\nAdd to that the fact that science still doesn't have the \"perfect\" solution for weight loss and maintenance, he said, and you've got an area that is ripe for exploitation.\n\n\"These dieting sites have a catchy name, the promise of lineage to established institutions, and that is what tends to spread across the Internet, instead of a peer-reviewed study,\" said Southwell, who directs the Science in the Public Sphere program at the nonprofit research group RTI Internationa l. \"And just like direct mail, if you get 5% of people to click through, you can make a huge profit. It doesn't cost much to unleash stuff online.\"\n\nDrayer agreed. \"I think a lot of people just want to know the next dieting magic bullet, quick fix, and they just go for these fad things.\"\n\nBut why are so many of us fooled in the first place?\n\nThe failure of some people's \"BS detectors\" when they encounter fake information can be explained, Southwell said, by what science now knows about how the brain processes data. Instead of sorting the good from bad as the information arrives, the brain accepts it all, \"and then in another part of the brain, it's tagged as true or false.\"\n\n\"It leaves open this window of opportunity,\" he explained, \"so people believe just long enough and then get tired, distracted, and what happens? They get sucked in. They might be skeptical at first but fail to do the research and think, 'well, maybe this will work. This might be my solution.' \"\n\nThe fact that so many of us share our discoveries with friends and loved ones on social accounts fuels the misinformation fire. Southwell calls it \"social contagion.\"\n\n\"It's like the dynamics of infectious disease. You've spread the disease before you've even come down with it, \" he explained. \"You find it, you share, you read more and find out that it's not effective, or you try it out and you're disappointed. But the genie is out of the bottle already.\"\n\nAccording to Southwell, that's exactly what many of these sites are counting on.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if it ultimately gets debunked, because it's going to take a while for it to reach the same numbers of people as the original rumor or fake diet,\" he explained. \"And the debunking is not as sexy as the original diet lure.\n\n\"In the meantime, you might see the spread of unhealthy dieting behavior, and for some people with certain diseases or conditions, that can cause real harm,\" Southwell said, such as heart disease or diabetes. \"But it can't be traced back. Who is culpable for that?\"\n\nHealthy ways to lose fast?\n\nLet's face it. We still want a quick way to lose 5 or 10 pounds fast, just in time for that special occasion. Is it possible to do so in a healthy way?\n\n\"I will prescribe a modified three-day diet just to jump-start weight loss,\" Drayer said. \"I typically recommend increasing your water intake and eliminating all starchy carbs like breads, pasta, cereal and rice, as well as sweets and treats for one week. Doing this not only cuts calories, but you also shed some extra water too, which can be motivating as the numbers on the scale go down.\"\n\nFor those who drink their calories, Drayer recommends slashing sugary beverages such as sodas, flavored lattes, fruit juices and smoothies, \"as the calories from these beverages can really add up.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMagee prefers to trick the body into losing weight, to avoid what she calls a starvation backlash.\n\n\"When you decrease your calories so severely as they do in the three-day military diet, your body tends to go into conservation mode and actually burns fewer calories,\" she said, \"because it thinks you are entering a potato famine or similar, and it wants to survive.\n\n\"I think it's better to trick your body into burning calories by decreasing the calories you eat a little, increasing exercise to burn more calories, to create a daily deficit of about 250 calories a day,\" she explains. \"It's slower but more sustained weight loss, and you are more likely to lose body fat rather than muscle tissue and water.\"\n\nRegardless of what method you try, said Drayer, remember that any diet should be cleared by your nutritionist or doctor before you begin. And when it comes to the three-day military diet, she concluded: \"I can't imagine any doctor or expert endorsing the military diet as healthy or beneficial in any way.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/30/health/3-day-military-diet-revealed/index.html", "published": "2017-06-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How to succeed at intermittent fasting", "text": "(CNN) \"Intermittent fasting,\" a dieting approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and abstaining from food, has been trending in diet circles. This is in part because reports claim that celebrities such as Beyonce, Hugh Jackman, Ben Affleck and Nicole Kidman are doing it but also because increasingly more research reveals that the eating pattern may promote weight loss and improve overall health.\n\nThe method is not appropriate for everyone, however, particularly pregnant women and those with medical conditions such as diabetes or eating disorders. And though studies are promising, it remains to be seen if this type of eating can become a sustainable lifestyle habit instead of a drop-a-dress-size-in-a-week fad.\n\n\"The jury is still out, especially on how healthy, sustainable and realistic this approach is,\" said Samantha Heller, a registered dietitian and senior clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health in New York. \"Eating very low calories, or none, on alternate days feels punitive to many and may exacerbate an already difficult and complex relationship someone has with food.\"\n\nIf you are still hoping to give intermittent fasting a try, there are some things to consider that can increase your chances of reaching your goals. Also, be sure to check with your doctor before starting a fasting regimen.\n\nPick the level of fasting you can handle\n\nThe appeal of intermittent fasting may be related to its simplicity, as it seems to require less effort than restricting calories every day. But there are different approaches to the eating pattern that vary in intensity.\n\nOne regimen known as time-restricted feeding advises consuming all of your calories within a range of three to 12 hours a day, whereas an approach known as the \"5:2\" diet advises eating 500 to 600 calories for two days of the week and eating whatever you want on the other five days. A third, much more stringent type of regimen involves alternating 24-hour fasting periods (in which no foods or calorie-containing beverages are consumed) with non-fasting days, during which anything can be eaten in any amount.\n\nThough time-restricted feeding might not seem that different from a typical eating day, especially if you tend to skip breakfast, alternate-day fasting may cause intense hunger on fasting days and can be much more challenging to sustain.\n\n\"People who are accustomed to eating regularly scheduled meals or suffer from 'head hunger' may find alternate-day fasting extremely difficult,\" said Kristen Smith, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Head hunger is the desire to eat when you are not physically hungry but are triggered to eat by emotions and social factors.\n\nFor the greatest success, Smith recommends choosing a fasting regimen that best suits your lifestyle, your health history and your ability to sustain fasting. For example, alternate-day fasting may not be appropriate for someone with an active job that requires manual labor or a job that centers around food, such as a chef.\n\nFocus on protein and fiber-rich foods on semi-fasting days\n\nProtein and fiber-rich foods will keep you feeling full and satisfied, which is important when calories are strictly limited. Healthy fats such as nuts and peanut butter can also curb hunger but provide a lot of calories for a small portion size.\n\nIf you are limiting your calories to about 500 to 600 per day, you might focus on one or two mini meals and snacks. Smith recommends a small piece of grilled salmon with half a cup of steamed veggies, grilled chicken over spaghetti squash, an egg-white omelet with veggies or black beans with a cup of veggies. For snacks, she favors fat-free plain Greek yogurt, two cups of plain popcorn, a cup of raw veggie sticks or a medium piece of fruit.\n\nHigh-volume foods such as soups may also help on semi-fasting days, as they can fill you up on fewer calories than solid foods. Additionally, meal replacement bars may provide a convenient option, especially if you don't feel like preparing food on fasting days.\n\nDon't gorge on non-fasting days\n\nOur bodies want to keep us alive. If we are consuming very few calories on certain days, when we do eat, our bodies are going to do everything they can to encourage us to eat a lot because they don't know when the next meal will be available, Heller explained. \"We also feel that as a reward for sticking to 500 calories or less, we are allowed and 'deserve' to eat large portions of whatever we want,\" she said.\n\nThat kind of reward can bring unintended consequences. \"Overdoing it on a non-fasting day and eating excessive calories may actually lead to consuming an amount of calories you would consume in two days and defeat the purpose of a fasting day,\" Smith said.\n\nIn other words, having pancakes with bacon for breakfast, a fried chicken sandwich for lunch and a cheeseburger with fries for dinner on a non-fasting day can stall weight loss and prevent you from reaching your goals.\n\nDon't go overboard with exercise on fasting days\n\nStrenuous exercise, such as cycling, running, high-impact aerobics and weight lifting, is not advised on fasting days because the body does not have the fuel available to sustain rigorous activity, Heller explained.\n\nIf you want to do some form of physical activity on those days, Smith recommends sticking with walking, stretching or gentle yoga.\n\nDrink enough water\n\nIf you decide to avoid food for any length of time, adequate hydration is important and should be maintained. \"On a fasting day, someone may be more likely to become dehydrated because they aren't eating regularly scheduled meals, which is a common time people hydrate,\" Smith said.\n\nFoods such as fruits, vegetables and broth-based soups contain significant amounts of water and can help you stay hydrated. Those fasting should be cautious with caffeine-containing beverages, as they may contribute to dehydration, Smith said.\n\nKnow when to stop\n\nIf you experience lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches,difficulty concentrating or any other symptoms that regularly interfere with your daily functioning, you should stop fasting.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"If any of these symptoms occur, it might be a good time to meet with a registered dietitian to discuss other dietary interventions that might be better suited for you,\" Smith said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/23/health/intermittent-fasting-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2018-03-23T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Eat healthier without quitting sugar", "text": "Not long ago, fat was the evil dietary villain. Before that it was salt. Now the sugar-free diet has exploded onto the health and wellness scene -- and seems to have topped many people's list of New Year's resolutions.\n\nSugar-free diets encourage people to avoid table sugar (sucrose), sweeteners such as honey and maple syrup, refined flours, condiments, soft drinks, sweets and some fruits such as bananas. Some also recommend eliminating or restricting dairy products.\n\nThe diet's advocates rightly note that excessive sugar consumption may lead to obesity and therefore increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.\n\nAnd it's true we are swallowing too much of the sweet stuff, with the average American consuming around 20 teaspoons of added sugar a day.\n\nBut you don't need to quit sugar to lift your game on healthy eating. Quitting sugar is unlikely to improve your health any more than cutting down on ultra-processed foods, eating more vegetables, cooking food from scratch and limiting how much extra sugar you eat and drink.\n\nAt best, the sugar-free diet is confusing and imposes an arbitrary set of rules that aren't based on scientific evidence. At worst, such a restrictive diet can create food fear or an unhealthy relationship with food.\n\nDiet mentality\n\nThe sugar-free diet is restrictive, with lists of \"allowed\" foods (such as whole grains, blueberries and grapefruits) and \"not allowed\" foods (such as white bread, bananas and raisins). This inadvertently promotes a diet mentality and causes followers to worry about accidentally eating something that's not allowed.\n\nPeople who worry about food are more likely to diet. This may be because they are worried specifically about their weight, or about the impact certain nutrients have on their health.\n\nResearch shows dieting is not effective over the long term and can lead to greater weight gain over time. The brain interprets dieting and restriction as a famine , which causes the storage of fat for future shortages.\n\nDieting is stressful. In response to this, our body releases stress hormones such as cortisol , which may cause the body to store fat, particularly in the abdominal area.\n\nWorrying about food can lead to stress , anxiety and depression, and is one of the defining features of the condition known as orthorexia\n\nOrthorexia is the overwhelming preoccupation with eating healthily. People with orthorexia spend a lot of time thinking and worrying about food and eliminating foods that are deemed impure or unhealthy. Some experts suggest this behaviour is a precursor to, or a form of, an eating disorder.\n\nEstimates suggest anywhere between 7% and 58% of the population may have the condition. There are no clear diagnostic criteria, which makes it difficult to measure its prevalence.\n\nBut we know 15% of women will experience an eating disorder at some stage in their life. So we need to ensure nutrition advice, however well-intentioned, doesn't promote or encourage disordered eating.\n\nCutting out the good stuff\n\nSome sugar-free diets advise people to cut out or restrict healthy foods and food groups such as fruit and dairy, without evidence to support their exclusion. This perpetuates the food fear/dietary restriction cycle and may contribute to nutrient deficiencies.\n\nThese diets also recommend people avoid fruit for a period of time , and then re-introduce a limited list of expensive \"healthy\" fruits (such as berries) while avoiding the cheaper \"unhealthy\" fruits such as bananas.\n\nWhole fruit is a wonderful source of fibre, essential vitamins and minerals, as well as antioxidants. Two serves of fruit per day can reduce the risk of developing some cancers, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Given American adults only consume half their daily requirements for fruit, the advice to restrict fruit further could result in people missing out on these benefits.\n\nMany sugar-free followers also avoid plain dairy products such as milk, yoghurt and cheese, due to the assumption these contain sugars.\n\nThe sugar in plain dairy products is the natural lactose (a carbohydrate), which is nothing to fear. Unnecessarily avoiding dairy may increase the risk of osteoporosis if not replaced with adequate levels of calcium from other sources.\n\nSugar replacements\n\nStrangely, many of the sugar-free recipes use expensive sugar alternatives -- such as rice malt syrup (due to its low fructose content), maple syrup (which is sometimes allowed and sometimes not) and dates -- to replace sugar.\n\nHowever, these are still sugars and contain the same number of calories per gram as any other sugar. These alternatives offer no additional nutritional benefits other than rice malt syrup, which is a useful option only for those with a fructose malabsorption issue, and dates, which contain fibre.\n\nPeople often eat more of the food containing these alternatives under the guise of it being sugar-free , which could lead to unintentional weight gain. One study found people ate about 35% more of a snack when it was perceived as healthy than when it was seen as unhealthy.\n\nWhat to do instead\n\nEat plenty of plants, enjoy whole grains, beans and legumes. Fruit is your friend -- not your enemy.\n\nMost people could probably eat a little less sugar, a little less often, but you don't have to quit it for good to be healthy.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSavour every mouthful of that chocolate cake or \"sometimes food\".

This is especially important for older individuals, for whom thirst can be a poor indicator of one's fluid needs. Additionally, since thirst can be mistaken for hunger, planning to drink throughout the day can help you avoid unnecessary snacking.\n\nCarrying a refillable water bottle can serve as a constant reminder to drink more. \"I used a water bottle that had a hook on it and hooked my keys on it ... so everywhere I go, I now have a water bottle. It becomes part of your routine,\" Passerrello said.\n\nIf plain water is unappealing, try adding fruit or vegetable slices such as oranges, lemons, strawberries or cucumber to boost flavor.

But there is something that may help the effort, and it's all-natural.\n\nResearch has shown that simply spicing up your diet may help you consume less salt and possibly less sugar, while potentially improving your health even beyond the reduction of salt and sugar.\n\nThere is more consistent evidence that spicy food helps curb salt cravings than sugar.\n\nIn a study involving more than 600 people from China whose brains were analyzed with PET/CT scans, researchers found that regions stimulated by intake of both salty and spicy foods overlapped. Because of similar activities taking place in this shared space (think of the overlapping parts of a Venn diagram), consuming spicy foods effectively enhanced one's sensitivity to salt, thereby helping people crave and consume less salt.\n\n\"We think that spicy food can trick our brain when tasting salty food. It makes us taste the same (level of) saltiness even when a reduced amount of salt is actually consumed,\" said study author Dr. Zhiming Zhu, professor and director of the Department of Hypertension and Endocrinology at the Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China.\n\nIn fact, researchers found that people who regularly enjoy spicy foods consumed 2.5 grams less salt in a day (that's 1,000 fewer milligrams of sodium) compared with those who typically steer clear of spice. They also had lower blood pressure.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the findings can be replicated in other populations outside China, said Richard David Wainford, associate professor in the Department of Pharmacology at the Boston University School of Medicine, in an accompanying editorial. Still, \"a lifestyle intervention that adds taste to the diet, in the form of extra spice and flavor, versus reduction of the pleasure given by the salt we add to our food, may have more success as a public health strategy to promote population-level dietary salt reduction,\" he added.\n\nSpice may have the potential to curb sugar cravings too, though the evidence is mixed. In one study involving 40 students from Denmark, when chili pepper was added to sweet, sour and bitter meals, participants experienced a greater desire to eat sweet foods compared with meals without chili added.\n\nIn another study, also from Denmark, people experienced a decreased desire for salty and spicy foods when they ate tomato soup with cayenne pepper compared with eating the soup without pepper. But their desire for sweet and fatty foods significantly increased when they consumed the spicy soup.\n\nNo pain, no weight gain?\n\nCapsaicin is the compound in chili peppers that is responsible for the burning sensation we experience when eating them. The compound has the ability to suppress sweet taste, which could also explain some findings.\n\nBut while some may enjoy the heat that capsaicin produces, it may also come with an unintended consequence.\n\n\"Capsaicin helps fight pain. Most of the time, you hear about this as a topical cream, but eating chili peppers also has benefits. It may be that when the pain goes away, you're stimulated to consume more sweet foods,\" said Mary-Jon Ludy, an associate professor of clinical nutrition at Bowling Green State University.\n\nIn a meta-analysis, involving more than 70 studies , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the McCormick Science Institute, researchers state that the balance of the literature suggests the capsaicin suppresses appetite, though the magnitude of the effects is small. \"Purposeful inclusion of these compounds in the diet may aid weight management, albeit modestly,\" the study stated.\n\n(Note that the National Institutes of Health is a federal government agency, and the McCormick Science Institute is an independent research organization that is owned and funded by spice product manufacturer McCormick & Co. Inc. The company said it does not influence the science institute's research priorities.)\n\nThe meta-analysis included the Danish study that found increased sugar cravings among those who consumed spicy meals. But it also included a study that found adding spice can actually curb sugar cravings . In that study, when people added half a teaspoon of red pepper to their lunch, they had a decreased desire to eat sugary, fatty and salty foods, and ate about 70 fewer calories at their next meal. The effects were seen only among those who didn't regularly consume red pepper.\n\n\"I think that there's something in the novelty of the stimulus that would allow you to eat less,\" said Ludy, who authored the study and the meta-analysis. \"In terms of the work with red pepper, I think that that's an important piece of the puzzle. If you are adding a spicy meal every couple of weeks, it might be enough to have an effect ... but if you have it every day, the effect goes away, because you get used to it.\"\n\nA little dash will do ya\n\nTo get started with spice, Ludy recommends sprinkling red pepper flakes into eggs in the morning. You can also use spice when making a rub for meat or when seasoning vegetables, soups, pasta or curry dishes.\n\nShe also recommends adding red pepper flakes to a meal in anticipation of a tempting dessert. \"It may give you that extra piece of security,\" she said. Though not specific to sweet taste, cinnamon, ginger and saffron are other pungent spices with appetite suppressive effects, according to Ludy.\n\nHowever you choose to use spice, it's wise to start slowly. \"Remember that a tiny bit of spice can go a long way!\" Ludy said. If the heat is an issue, you can calm your taste buds by pairing hot spices with healthy fats, such as avocados and nuts, according to Ludy. \"They help break down the chemical that causes the burn.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you're new to spicy peppers, she recommends starting with milder varieties, such as jalapeno or serrano, which cause less burn than cayenne or habanero. \"These peppers still contain some capsaicin but not as much. Although I haven't researched it directly, my guess is that there would still be appetite effects (perhaps of a lesser magnitude) ... but if you can't tolerate higher quantities of spice, something is better than nothing, right?\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/17/health/spicy-salt-sugar-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2017-11-17T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Is cheese healthy?", "text": "(CNN) Yes, cheese is nutrient-rich -- and tasty -- but it's best to consume it in small portions.\n\n\"Cheese does contain some important nutrients, including calcium and protein, along with vitamin B12 and zinc. However, the calories can add up quickly if you aren't mindful,\" said Kelly Pritchett, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\nSofter cheeses tend to have fewer calories than hard cheeses: an ounce of whole-milk ricotta (approximately 2 tablespoons) has about 50 calories, an ounce of feta has 75 calories, and an ounce of whole-milk mozzarella has 85 calories. But an ounce of Swiss (one slice) has 108 calories, and an ounce of cheddar has 114 calories (picture about a one-inch cube, depending on the kind).\n\nFor the same calories, you can have a cup of black bean soup and probably feel just as full.\n\nCheese is also high in saturated fat, which is known to increase LDL cholesterol, the \"bad\" cholesterol. In fact, cheese is one of the biggest sources of saturated fat in the US diet\n\nSome research (supported by the Danish dairy board) suggests that full-fat cheeses don't seem to negatively affect LDL cholesterol as would be predicted based on its saturated fat content.\n\n\"It is not clear exactly why this is the case but may have to do with other nutrients in cheese, like calcium or protein, modifying the way the fat is absorbed or metabolized,\" said Gregory D. Miller, chief science officer for the National Dairy Council.\n\nStill, when it comes to fat content, some cheeses are lighter than others -- and the higher the fat, the higher the calories. Cottage cheese has the least amount of fat, with 1 gram per ounce. Ricotta has 4 grams of fat per ounce, and feta and mozzarella have 6 grams each. Parmesan, Swiss and cheddar are higher in fat, with 7, 8 and 9 grams of fat per ounce, respectively.\n\n\"Using soft cheeses like mozzarella versus cheddar can be helpful if you are looking for ways to cut calories,\" Pritchett said.\n\nInterestingly, despite its higher calorie content, hard cheese like cheddar can be beneficial for your teeth. Aside from getting calcium and other minerals from it, consuming hard cheese generates saliva , which helps make your mouth less acidic and your teeth less prone to cavities.\n\nPritchett suggests using cheese as a flavor enhancer for meals instead of making it the focus: sprinkle feta or goat cheese on a salad for extra flavor, or add Parmesan to your favorite soup for extra pep. And if you are enjoying cheese with crackers, limit it to 1 ounce.\n\n\"This would be the equivalent of a couple of dominos for softer cheeses like Brie, goat cheese or Havarti and about 4 small dice for hard cheese like Swiss or cheddar.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nLimiting portions will also keep sodium levels in check, as it can be as high as 260 milligrams for an ounce of feta and 390 milligrams for an ounce of hard Parmesan.\n\nSo feel free to enjoy cheese, but just be careful not to overdo it.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/25/health/cheese-healthy-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2017-09-25T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Is dark chocolate healthy?", "text": "(CNN) Yes, dark chocolate has compounds that offer health benefits and can be enjoyed without guilt, even on a daily basis. But the portion size matters, since too many bites can contribute extra fat, sugar and calories and negate its health benefits.\n\nDark chocolate is rich in cocoa solids, which contain compounds known as flavanols. At high levels, cocoa flavanols have been shown to help lower blood pressure and cholesterol, improve cognition and possibly lower the risk of diabetes. Dark chocolate has the highest amount of cocoa flavanols; milk chocolate has less, and white chocolate has none.\n\nBut while cocoa flavanols in dark chocolate make it a healthful treat, they give it a bitter flavor. Manufacturers may process chocolate to make it more palatable, but doing so can remove some of these beneficial compounds\n\nFactors in processing, including fermentation and roasting, which deepen the flavor and give chocolate its distinct aroma, can affect flavanol content, explained Matt Hartings, assistant professor of chemistry at American University.\n\n\"Roasting generates all sorts of new flavors ... and to generate those flavors, you have to destroy molecules in the unroasted bean ... and there is always the chance that it is destroying compounds that we want around, including flavanols,\" Hartings said.\n\nThough the flavanol content may vary among dark chocolate brands, it's still a healthier choice than milk chocolate, which also tends to have more sugar.\n\nIf you need more justification to enjoy dark chocolate, consider this: A third of the fat in cocoa butter is stearic acid, a saturated fat that, unlike other saturated fats, appears to have a neutral effect on blood cholesterol . Additionally, cocoa powder contributes minerals, including calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium and zinc.\n\nSo feel free to enjoy a piece of dark chocolate after a meal. Just keep a few facts in mind before you indulge.\n\nFirst, buy chocolate that is at least 60% cacao (i.e. cocoa). Generally speaking, the higher the percentage, the more flavanols, though the exact amount varies from batch to batch and depends on the extent of processing, according to Hartings.\n\n\"These higher-percentage chocolates have the added benefit over the lower percentages and milk and white chocolates because they contain less sugar and less fat,\" he said.\n\nSecond, if possible, choose natural cocoa over Dutch processed cocoa, which is treated with an alkali, a compound that neutralizes acid. This gives chocolate a milder flavor but removes healthful flavanols.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you are cooking, the ultimate choice of cocoa will depend on the recipe, according to Hartings. \"Some things are just better if you bake with Dutch processed cocoa,\" he said. \"If one ingredient in a recipe is highly acidic, then with natural cocoa, it may be too acidic.\"\n\nAnd finally, to keep weight in check, limit portions to 1 ounce of dark chocolate daily, or about 150 calories.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/06/health/dark-chocolate-healthy-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2017-10-06T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How to break carb cravings, once and for all", "text": "(CNN) If you're like many people I know, the thought of giving up pasta and bread in an effort to shed a few pounds (or more) might seem like an unfair punishment -- perhaps even a tease, especially when those foods seem to be on everyone else's plates.\n\nThe truth is, despite the popularity of low-carb diets, which often send the message that we should drastically cut back on this food group, carbohydrates are some of the most important things we consume. They are key to regulating blood sugar and providing energy throughout our bodies. Without them, our bodies will rely on protein, breaking it down for energy instead of using it in its preferred role of growing and maintaining tissues.\n\nWhat's more, eating the \"right\" kinds of carbs can keep us healthier.\n\n\"The people who live the longest, healthiest lives -- who have the lowest rates of diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- their diets are all rich in healthy carbs, including beans, legumes, whole grains and fruit,\" said Tamara Duker Freuman, a New York City-based registered dietitian.\n\nAnd so there's nothing wrong with a pasta meal (though whole grain is preferred) or even a sandwich on whole-wheat bread for lunch every day. Simply, the problem is not that we consume carbs; it's that we often consume the wrong kinds of carbs -- and very large portions of them.\n\nProcessed carbs are problem carbs\n\nHighly processed carbs -- white bread, sugary cereal, white rice, regular pasta and bagels, for example -- produce rapid rises and drops in blood sugar, which can lead to weight gain. They also can lead to something called metabolic syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\nMetabolic syndrome is \"the combination of high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance and obesity,\" explained Dr. David Ludwig, professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"And processed carbs are the main dietary drivers.\" Studies show that \"processed carbs top the list for weight gain and diabetes risk,\" he said.\n\nThe tricky part is that the more processed, refined carbs we eat, the more we crave. And so it seems almost impossible to get off the carb-craving hamster wheel.\n\nAccording to Ludwig, who wrote the book \"Always Hungry? Conquer Cravings, Retrain Your Fat Cells, and Lose Weight Permanently,\" cravings have to do with our consumption of these highly processed, \"fast-acting\" carbs, which he says are not fundamentally different from sugar, in the biological sense. White bread or any other processed carbohydrate will melt into glucose very quickly -- and so like sugar, it raises blood sugar at a faster rate than slower-digesting carbs that are less processed and higher in fiber. The problem is, that rapid spike in blood sugar is eventually followed by a crash.\n\nInsulin: Miracle-Gro for fat cells\n\nAccording to Ludwig, what drives most carb cravings is not the taste of the foods per se but rather a biological urge to eat something to restore your blood sugar. And it has to do with the hormone insulin. \"Processed carbs cause more insulin secretion, calorie for calorie, than any food,\" he said.\n\nWhen you eat processed carbs, blood sugar rises rapidly, and insulin quickly follows, directing incoming calories into liver, muscle and fat cells. But of these, only fat cells have virtually limitless ability to store calories, and too many get trapped there, according to Ludwig. A short while later, the calories in the bloodstream are low, and the body runs out of available fuel, making you hungry too soon after the meal.\n\nIn essence, when fat cells get too much energy, there's not enough to fuel the brain, which is constantly monitoring the calories in your blood. \"When (the brain) sees calories are dropping, it triggers hunger and cravings,\" Ludwig said.\n\nAnd it all relates back to that initial insulin response. \"Insulin is the Miracle-Gro for fat cells,\" he said. \"When fat cells grow, we get hungry.\" And so the cycle repeats, eventually causing weight gain.\n\nHow to break carb cravings\n\nNutrition experts say that breaking carb cravings is not about getting rid of carbs entirely but rather cutting back on highly processed fast-acting carbs and eating more high-quality ones that are high in fiber and low in added sugars, such as beans, whole grains, fruit and vegetables. If you don't know how to get started, this plan can help:\n\n1. Cut out all starchy carbs for one week. This includes all pasta, bread, rice, bagels and potatoes, as well as pizza, crackers, pretzels, chips, cookies and cake.\n\nBy cutting starchy carbs and replacing them with foods that have a more modest impact on blood sugar, you can achieve more steady blood sugar control and better manage your cravings, according to Freuman.\n\nA day might include egg whites and cheese with berries for breakfast, yogurt for a snack, a grilled chicken salad with beans for lunch, an apple for a snack and a piece of fish and veggies for dinner.\n\n2. Slash the sugary carbs too, including candy and sugar-sweetened beverages. These sugary carbs rapidly flood the bloodstream, providing lots of sugar without any added nutrition.\n\n3. Add some fat. \"Many high-fat foods are luscious and do not cause an insulin release, so they keep your blood sugar much more stable,\" Ludwig said. Examples include nuts, nut butters, avocado, olive oil, dark chocolate and full-fat dairy. \"When you are eating them, you don't miss the processed carbs at all!\"\n\n4. After the first week, you can gradually add back high-quality starchy carbs, starting with breakfast.\n\n\"Research in a variety of populations has shown that eating carbs at breakfast seems to dampen the blood sugar effect of eating carbs at lunch,\" Freuman said. What this means is that on a day that you skip breakfast, you may be more likely to have a blood sugar spike after eating a carb-rich lunch, compared with a day when you eat breakfast but have the same lunch. In other words, \"don't skip breakfast, and don't skip carbs at breakfast,\" Freuman said.\n\nHigh-quality carbs -- including minimally processed grains, along with non-starchy vegetables, whole fruits and beans -- are the ones to choose. They are delicious and slower-digesting, thanks to the way they are naturally packaged, Ludwig said. \"If you eat wheat berries, your body has to digest the intact grain kernel, and that's a slow process. But if you mill it and turn it into flour, now that whole package has been broken. Too much of these 'naked carbs' (stripped of their bran and germ, which contain nutrients) will cause metabolic problems for most people.\"\n\nBreakfast examples with high-quality carbs include steel-cut oats with nuts, seeds and cinnamon; rye crisp bread with scrambled eggs and berries; or Greek yogurt topped with fruit. Freuman recommends beans at breakfast too, \"as in a Mexican breakfast with eggs, beans, avocado and salsa.\"\n\n5. After the second week, you can add back high-quality starchy carbs (i.e. minimally processed grains) to lunch. Good lunch examples include a chickpea or quinoa salad, bean or lentil soups, mushroom barley soup or a sandwich with whole-grain bread. Whole-wheat pasta or chickpea pasta is a good choice too, according to Freuman, though it should take up only about a quarter of the plate, to allow room for veggies and protein.\n\nFor the longer term\n\n6. Continue to skip starchy carbs at dinner. \"At dinner, when we eat carbs, we are much more likely to have a blood sugar spike and to store that food energy as fat versus having it available for useable energy,\" Freuman said.\n\n\"The metabolic response to a carbier meal at night is less favorable than when we eat carbs earlier in the day, so if there is ever one meal that you want eat low-carb, it's dinner ... and if you want to include them, choose wisely and keep the portions low,\" she added.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n7. Continue to limit refined carbs, such as white bread and white rice. It might be difficult to forgo white basmati rice, pizza or sushi entirely, but limit these foods to a few times per week.\n\n8. Continue to avoid foods high in added sugars. If you have a sweet tooth, limit treats to 100 to 150 calories per day, depending on your goals.\n\nAnd note that anyone with a medical issue should always consult their doctor before starting a new diet plan.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/17/health/carbohydrates-cravings-food-drayer/index.html", "published": "2017-10-17T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The annual running of the ... burros?", "text": "(CNN) Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible, Jesus rode one, not a horse, into Jerusalem.\n\nThe significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king, rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant, though that's not in the official canon. I checked.\n\nDomesticated for about 5,000 years, donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car, our U-Haul vans, engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West, and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.\n\nBurros, as the Spanish call them, walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve, the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.\n\nLike a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow, donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains, while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact, they're the camels of the East, North and South, too, as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n\nAs some industries faded, the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s, some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race.\n\n\"They teach us so much,\" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. \"They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul.\"\n\nThe first race was in 1949, which makes it, according Wann, the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon.\n\nThe race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example, the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation . There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.\n\nBut it's still a serious sport, even if it has a sense of humor. \" Haulin' Ass \" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.\n\nA burro-ful day\n\nOriginally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay, located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies, but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.\n\nNow both towns have their own races, part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay, is the longest (29 miles), tied for highest (more than 13,000 feet), and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument, possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.\n\nPhotos: Pack Burro World Championship At the annual World Championship Pack Burro Race in Colorado, it's not just about running an ultramarathon, it's about getting your ass across the finish line, too.

This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship, assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150,000 people showed up to watch the start of the race.\n\nThe smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3,300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.\n\nThe start of the race is critical, explained Wann. \"Don't break their will, let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down,\" he explained. \"Burros will pair up and want to go that pace, and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race, not a human race.\"\n\nThe course also ends in Fairplay, running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode), and then heading up dirt roads, trails and rocky terrain to the 13,185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?)\n\nThe age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70, and they came from all over the US, Europe, Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado, the state where it was born.\n\nAbout a third of the runners were women this year. In fact, the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller, with her burro Pill, in 1951, nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules, even then).\n\nThe donks -- as insiders may refer to them -- that competed this year have adorable and delicious names such as Buckwheat, Hershey and Sweet Pea. Past winners have included BonBon and Cream Puff. My favorite name for a competitor this year was ReDONKulous. This year included 16 mini-donkeys on the short course.\n\nAnd don't call donkeys mules, which are actually half donkey and half horse breeds. Those half-assed animals aren't allowed to race in the pack burro circuit.\n\nRules state that the donks (I'm an insider now) must carry mining equipment: a pick, gold pan, shovel and saddle. This weighs about 16 pounds and for the mini-donkeys that's all they need; standard-sized donkeys must add weights to a minimum of 33 pounds. The rope attaching the team can't be longer than 15 feet and the runners don't dress as miners, though the occasional cowboy hat may allude to an earlier era.\n\nLike any ultramarathon, especially with elevation, endurance requires training. And in this case some animal husbandry skills as well. As a result, there are, of course, comical moments for bystanders watching when the donkey protests. Sometimes a burro will just shut down. In previous races, teams have had to drop out when this happens.\n\nThe air may be thin on oxygen up on Mosquito Pass, but the mountain views are amazing. Green and grey peaks are in all directions, the views as wild and West as some of pack animals.\n\nThis year's winning team was Kirt Courkamp and his burro Mary Margaret, finishing the 29 miles in just over 6 hours and winning the $1,000 first place prize. These two locals won the last two years and this year won in Leadville and Buena Vista too, collectively known as the Triple Crown.\n\nBreaking in\n\n\"In the whole world, there are probably fewer than 1,000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race,\" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 , arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012, pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)\n\nIf you want to be among this elite crew, your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances \u2014 putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.\n\nThen there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible.\n\nThere are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. \"If the burro doesn't trust you, or like you, or you are pushing too hard,\" said Wann, \"it's not going to work.\"\n\nOrganizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann, a self described \"donkey matchmaker\" and wife of Brad, rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience.\n\n\"Burro racing is a very mental game,\" he added. \"We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen.\"\n\nRunning with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill, runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.\n\nOn flats, either teammate can be in the lead, or side-by-side, but human runners are still doing the steering.\n\nYou control a donkey through their nose, pulling back on the rope to slow down, like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a \"hup-hup!\" can get 'em goin' and the classic \"whoa\" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the \"GPS for the critters,\" Wann said.\n\nGear-wise, runners need the right shoes, clothes, running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros, in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet, need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.\n\nAss-essing risk and reward\n\nAs with any ultramarathon trail run, injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1,212 active ultrarunners, they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners , though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n\nBeing tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners, of course. If you trip, you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest.\n\nThe rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey, but in the race's history, injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back, as they're out of the race anyway.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDonkeys get injured too, but in 70 years of racing, not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery.\n\nAnimal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. \"Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified,\" the race rules state. \"No needles, electric prods, narcotics, clubs or whips, other than the halter rope, may be used.\" But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous.\n\nOrganizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. \"If you observe donkeys in the wild, they aren't sedentary creatures,\" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. \"In the wild, donkeys are very trim athletic animals\" and \"they exercise all day long.\"\n\n\"They are willing participants,\" Thompson writes, alluding to the burro's famous stubbornness. \"If they don't want to go, you can't make them do anything.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/15/health/pack-burro-donkey-sport-fit-nation/index.html", "published": "2018-09-15T00:00:00"}, {"title": "6 common mistakes new runners make", "text": "Story highlights When starting to run, don't do too much too soon\n\nYou need to take rest days\n\nMake sure you have the right gear\n\nRunning is a great way to get in shape and just about everyone can do it. You don't need access to a fancy gym, expensive equipment, or other people to do the workout. You can simply throw on your sneakers and head out the door for a run. Easy as that!\n\nGiven that it's so easy to take up the sport, a lot of beginners jump right into running without actually knowing what it takes to establish a healthy routine. Many make a number of common mistakes, which can interfere with training or lead to injury. If you're just starting out, keep these things in mind to help you increase your chances of running success.\n\nDoing too much too soon\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes newbie runners make is doing too much too soon. Picking up a new hobby like running is no doubt exciting, but novice runners need to ease into the sport by building up a mileage base before increasing the distance, intensity, and frequency of their runs. Slowly easing into a training program will help reduce the risk of injury, so you can continue on with your new running routine. Many experts suggest increasing your mileage by no more than 10% each week.\n\nRead More\n\nNot taking rest days Beginners might think they need to run every day (or nearly every day) to meet their fitness or weight-loss goals, but this couldn't be further from the truth. Running is a high-impact activity which can be really hard on your body, especially for novice runners whose muscles and bones haven't yet been conditioned for such intense exercise. So it's important to give your body ample rest between workouts. Follow a training plan that includes rest days. Health.com: 16 ways to lose weight fast Not wearing the right gear While it may be true that you don't need expensive equipment to take up running, it's important that you wear proper gear for your workouts. The most important piece of equipment for running is a good pair of running shoes, so be sure to do some research before you purchase a pair. Visit a running specialty store and ask an employee to fit you for a shoe. They will analyze your gait and then recommend a few options in your budget. Also essential: A supportive sports bra. Not cross-training When newbies take up running, they typically dive head first into their training with run after run. Running definitely makes you a better runner, but not if your regular exercise routine lacks variety in the form of cross-training. It's important to mix up your workouts so you're not always using the same muscles, which can put you at risk for overuse injuries and ultimately derail your efforts. Health.com: 24 fat-burning ab exercises (no crunches!) Running through pain Running can be uncomfortable at times, especially for new runners. That feeling is all part of becoming a better runner, but pain is a different story altogether. If something hurts when you run, you need to stop and treat the pain. Remember: It doesn't make you less of a runner if you listen to your body to keep it healthy. Don't run through pain unless you want to end up on the sidelines. Comparing yourself to others When you're just starting out with running, it's tough not to compare yourself to others. You're excited about running, so you're probably reading running blogs, magazines, and message boards where you might start to feel inadequate about your own mileage or running pace. Instead of getting down on yourself, remember that every runner was once a beginner and use their success as motivation!

It also allows us to understand and label emotions as well as express and regulate them, according to Yale University's Marc Brackett.\n\nMost of us would probably like to think that we can do all of the above. We spot and understand emotions in ourselves and others and label them accurately in order to guide our thoughts and actions.\n\nBut many of us tend to overestimate our own emotional intelligence, according to Brackett, a professor in the Child Study Center at Yale and founding director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.\n\nThat's important because experts say the ability to read, understand and respond to emotions in ourselves and other people is a crucial factor in predicting our health, happiness and personal and professional success.\n\nSo maybe we all need to take a breath and invest a little more time in schooling ourselves on what it means to be emotionally intelligent.\n\nWhat is emotional intelligence?\n\nThe theory of emotional intelligence -- and the term itself -- originated at Yale and the University of New Hampshire. Peter Salovey, the 23rd president of Yale University, and John \"Jack\" Mayer, professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire, wrote up the theory in 1990, Brackett said.\n\nTheir work demonstrated how emotions had a marked impact on an individual's thinking and behavior, said Robin Stern, associate director for the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and an educator, author and licensed psychoanalyst.\n\nExperts have continued to build on that framework to refine definitions of what exactly is at the core of of emotional intelligence. \"Emotional intelligence is being smart about your feelings. It's how to use your emotions to inform your thinking and use your thinking to inform your emotions,\" she said.\n\nIt's having an awareness of how your emotions drive your decisions and behaviors so you can effectively engage with and influence others, said Sara Canaday, a leadership speaker and author. Individuals who are emotionally intelligent tend to be empathetic, can look at situations from an alternative point of view, are considered open-minded, bounce back from challenges and pursue their goals despite any obstacles they might face, according to Canaday.\n\n\"Some people think of emotional intelligence as a soft skill or the ability or the tendency to be nice. It's really about understanding what is going on for you in the moment so that you can make conscious choices about how you want to use your emotions and how you want to manage yourself and how you want to be seen in the world,\" Stern said.\n\n\"People with more emotional intelligence are healthier, happier and more effective,\" Brackett said.\n\nWhy emotional intelligence matters\n\nCanaday further suggests that emotional intelligence is a better predictor of career success than an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or a high IQ score\n\nWait, really?\n\nWell ... just reflect on your own work experiences, Canaday suggests.\n\nHas anyone you worked with ever been let go or asked to leave, even when they had the competency or technical skills for the job?\n\n\"We might be hired for technical talents, but we are often fired because we lack emotional intelligence,\" Canaday said.\n\nIndividuals with a low level of emotional intelligence can be successful, she said, but she argues that those individuals could be even more successful if they had a higher level of emotional intelligence.\n\n\"It is how well you can collaborate, how well you engage with others and influence. It's the stories you can tell, the way you can bring data to life in a way that connects with others. Those are the things that are going to set you apart.\"\n\nEmotional intelligence tests\n\nBehavioral scientists have created a number of emotional intelligence self-assessments, usually broken down into \"your ability to manage yourself, your ability to manage relationships, your self-awareness and your social awareness,\" according to Canaday.\n\nYour results will be measured along with others who have taken the assessment to give some indication of where you fall on the spectrum from low to high emotional intelligence.\n\nBut Brackett warns that \"measurement is a tricky subject.\"\n\nIn his early research, he found that people tend to overestimate their emotional intelligence, which is why he believes you must measure it through performance assessments. In a performance assessment, people are required to problem-solve; they must decode facial expressions or strategize in an emotionally tense situation. That way, their knowledge and skills can be tested as opposed to their beliefs about them.\n\nAnother form of an emotional intelligence test is a \"360 assessment.\"\n\nIn the workplace setting, a 360 assessment is a process involving feedback from colleagues and supervisors evaluating a person emotional intelligence. Canaday believes that we often \"see ourselves differently than others do.\"\n\nWhen a coworker takes the 360 assessment of you it provides an opportunity to compare it to your self-assessment. Another way to take a 360 assessment without undergoing a formal test is to ask a trusted adviser, perhaps a current or former boss, to evaluate your emotional intelligence, she said.\n\nBut, Canaday cautions, If you ask for someone's feedback, be prepared to accept what they share. \"This stuff can feel very personal. On one hand, we say we want to learn and grow, but on the other hand, we want to be accepted just the way we are, and those two human traits run counter.\"\n\nCan I improve my emotional intelligence?\n\nSo maybe you need to improve your emotional intelligence. How do you do that?\n\nFrom the earliest ages, children should be taught how to recognize their emotions, understand what those emotions mean and label them accurately in order to to express and manage themselves , Stern said.\n\nFor adults who did not receive a solid education on emotional intelligence, improving will require some hard work. Canaday suggests creating an action plan including specific goals. \"Pick one or two areas where you want to grow, and get some advice on how to best start to embody whatever factor of emotional intelligence you are trying to develop.\"\n\nIf you are trying to gain better control of your anger, for example, you might find a healthy outlet for it -- whether it be yoga meditation or boxing\n\nCanaday also suggests seeking out perspectives from those who may not agree with you. \"Be intentional about that. Take active steps to do that. If you constantly surround yourself with people who believe just like you do, then you are hearing the same conversations, and you are not growing, and you are not learning to be open to perspectives.\"\n\nBrackett advises seeking out strategies that are effective for managing emotions. Practice them and then evaluate how those strategies are working for you. It's important to \"spend time reflecting on and thinking about your influence and how people respond to your emotions, be more self- and socially aware about your presence.\"\n\nStern suggests prolonging the time between when you are triggered by something and when you respond. Pause, slow down and take a deep breath. Imagine what your best self looks like. Taking the time to pause and think about what your best self would do in each situation may help you avoid letting your emotions control you. You are allowing yourself time to manage your emotions.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"There is no question in my mind that if people were to really appreciate how important emotions are, allowed themselves to have emotions, made space for other people to have their emotions and handled those emotions skillfully in the service of making a better world, we would in fact have a better world.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/04/11/health/improve-emotional-intelligence/index.html", "published": "2018-04-11T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Want a happy marriage? Science says to do this", "text": "Have you ever waited with excitement to share some amazingly good news with your partner, only to experience a surge of frustration and resentment when he or she barely reacts to your announcement? As a society, we place a huge amount of emphasis on being there for each other when we're in need, but past research has actually shown that relationship satisfaction is influenced as much, if not more, by how we react to each other's good news. Whereas emotional support from a partner when we're down can have the unfortunate side-effect of making us feel indebted and more aware of our negative emotions, a partner's positive reaction to our good news can magnify the benefits of that good fortune and make us feel closer to them.\n\nNow an unusual brain-imaging study , published in Human Brain Mapping, has added to this picture, showing that the relationship satisfaction of longtime married elderly women is particularly related to the neural activity they show in response to their husbands' displays of positive emotion, rather than negative emotion.\n\nPsychologist Raluca Petrican at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto and her colleagues at the University of Toronto recruited 14 women with an average age of 72 who'd been married for an average of 40 years. The researchers scanned these women's brains as they watched some carefully prepared videos.\n\nThe silent 10-second videos showed each woman's husband or a stranger displaying an emotion that mismatched the way the video clip was labeled in a one-sentence description on the screen. For example, the clip might show the husband smiling or laughing about a happy memory (such as the first house they bought), but the video was labeled misleadingly to suggest that the man was showing this emotion while talking about a sad memory (such as the time he got fired). Other videos showed the reverse mismatch: a negative emotional display, ostensibly shown while talking about the memory of a happy event.\n\nEssentially, the videos were designed to make the women feel like they were seeing their husband or the stranger display a surprising emotional reaction that didn't match their own feelings. The real-world equivalent would be a situation in which a husband is happy about something that his wife doesn't \"get\"; and the questions are whether she will notice, and whether she is she more sensitive to this incongruent emotion in her husband than she would be in a stranger.\n\nThe first important finding to emerge from this setup was that the women showed enhanced overall brain activity -- which suggests more mental and emotional neural processing -- when watching the videos of their husbands compared with videos of the strangers, but only when the videos showed displays of surprisingly incongruent positive emotion. During the other types of videos (when the men appeared to display strangely negative emotion), the women's brains showed just as much overall activity when watching a stranger as when watching their husband. In other words, their levels of whole-brain activity betrayed a special sensitivity to their husband's (versus a stranger's) unexpected positive emotion.\n\nThis jibes with the past research that's shown it's our response to our partners' positive news that is all-important for relationship satisfaction. Remember that these women had been married for decades, so it's likely that they and their husbands have been doing something right relationship-wise. The brain-imaging data suggest part of the reason might be that the women are acutely tuned to when their husbands are showing happiness that's personal to them (rather than common to both partners).\n\nThis specific interpretation trips up a little with another main result: The women's levels of marital satisfaction (according to a questionnaire) correlated with the amount of neural processing they showed in response to their husbands positive and negative emotion.\n\nHowever, the special importance of how we respond to our partners' positive emotion was supported by another key finding. Namely, women who scored higher on relationship satisfaction showed more brain activation in regions thought to contain mirror neurons (neurons that are considered important for empathy) when watching their spouses than they did when watching a stranger. Moreover, this enhanced mirror-neuron activity was especially present for the videos showing their husbands' positive, rather than negative, emotion. Again, this appears to support the idea that marital happiness goes hand in hand with sensitivity to our partners' positive emotion (though the researchers acknowledge a different or complementary interpretation that people in happy relationships have a suppressed response to their partners' incongruent negative emotion).\n\nWe need to interpret these preliminary and complex findings with caution. And the exclusive focus on wives' reactions to their husbands' emotions does lend the study a slightly retro '70s vibe -- what about the way that husbands respond to their wives' emotions, and the importance of that for the marital happiness of both parties? But that said, the results are tantalizing in suggesting that at a neural level, people in a long-term, committed relationship are especially sensitive to their partners' positive emotion, and particularly so when this emotion is different from their own. This neatly complements other past research showing, for example, that people who are unable to differentiate their partners' emotions from their own (they assume they're the same), tend to be viewed by their partners as more controlling and smothering.\n\nAs a whole, this entire body of research gives pause for thought.

Alzheimer's disease , an irreversible and progressive brain disease, is the most common type of dementia.\n\nAbout 5.4 million people in the United States are estimated to be living with Alzheimer's disease , and it is the sixth leading cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAbout 850,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia as a whole, according to the UK's National Health Service\n\nWorldwide, about 50 million people have dementia, and there are nearly 10 million new cases every year, according to the World Health Organization\n\nJUST WATCHED How Alzheimer's disease destroys the brain Replay More Videos ...

During that time, the researchers tracked the women's health, taking a close look at who was diagnosed with dementia and who was not.\n\nThe researchers found that among all of the women, 44 of them (or 23%) developed dementia from 1968 to 2012. Yet among those who interrupted their cycling test at submaximal workload, that percentage jumped to 45%.\n\n\"Many of those who interrupted the test at submax, very low watt level, probably had indications for a poor cardiovascular health status,\" H\u00f6rder said. \"This might indicate that processes in the cardiovascular system might be ongoing many decades before onset of dementia diagnosis.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that the average age at dementia onset was 11 years older in the \"high fitness\" group than in the \"medium fitness\" group, and the most pronounced risk reduction was seen among those with the highest fitness: \"High compared to medium fitness decreased the risk of dementia by 88%,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that it involved a small sample of women in Sweden. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would occur in a larger, more diverse group.\n\nAlso, the findings were not causal. So more research is also needed to determine whether improved fitness could have positive effects on dementia risk and when in life a high fitness level is most important.\n\nFor instance, other factors could have influenced the findings to help lower dementia risk, regardless of physical activity habits. Genetics or the cognitive stimulation of fitness could have influenced dementia risk, as well as the social aspects of fitness, as loneliness has been linked to dementia\n\n\"One of the missing pieces of a study like this -- and really the weakness in the literature to date -- is that the kinds of studies that we have mostly seen are association studies. These are studies of correlations, and they can't necessarily talk about causality,\" said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nStill, he said, \"the picture that is really emerging from the literature is a picture about the importance of fitness in midlife, not just old age, when it comes to protecting your brain health and preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.\"\n\nThe new study adds to that overall growing body of evidence turning a spotlight on dementia and modifiable risk factors , such as poor cardiovascular health, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, smoking or excessive alcohol consumption\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSo people could try to reduce their risk of cognitive decline by engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise , stopping smoking, eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, staying socially engaged, challenging their minds by reading or playing games and of course taking care of their heart health, according to the Alzheimer's Association\n\n\"There's a very strong connection between cardiovascular health -- so the health of your heart and your circulatory system -- and the health of your brain,\" Fargo said.\n\n\"The reason for that is because the brain actually is what we would call a highly vascularized organ, meaning that your brain has many blood vessels,\" he said. \"The demand for nutrient-, oxygen-rich blood in the brain is very high compared to other organs, and so anything a person can do to increase their cardiovascular fitness level is likely to have positive benefits on brain health.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/14/health/dementia-risk-fitness-study/index.html", "published": "2018-03-14T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The top fitness trends for 2018", "text": "(CNN) High-intensity interval training will be the No. 1 fitness trend in the coming year, while smartphone exercise apps that prompt your activities will be out -- or so says the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends for 2018 .\n\nSuch training, known as HIIT, typically involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by a short period of rest or recovery: intermittently sprinting for 30 seconds, for example, during a moderate-pace jog.\n\nThe US national physical activity guidelines recommend 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week with additional muscle-strengthening exercise for adults and 60 minutes a day for children, noted Walter R. Thompson, author of the report and prtesident of the American College of Sports Medicine. \"So if you step it up a little bit and get your heart rate up and move from, say, walking to jogging, it decreases to 75 minutes per week.\"\n\nHIIT is a worthy way to meet your physical activity guidelines, he said. \"But there's a word of caution with that: Anytime you do high-intensity anything, there may be an increased risk of injury.\"\n\nIf you doubt your ability to safely exercise in high-intensity bursts, Thompson recommends that you \"get a good physical exam\" before starting a program.\n\nOver the past 12 years, the editors of the American College of Sports Medicine's Health & Fitness Journal have circulated an electronic survey to thousands of professionals, including personal trainers and physical therapists, to predict the biggest health and fitness trends for the coming year.\n\nThis year's survey, which included responses from 4,133 fitness professionals around the globe, placed \"group training\" -- classes involving more than five participants -- in the No. 2 slot. Meanwhile, \"wearable technology\" -- such as activity trackers and smartwatches -- came in third, and \"body weight training\" -- the use of your own body weight as a form of resistance while doing modified pushups and other exercises -- came in fourth. \"Strength training,\" or the use of barbells and weights, placed fifth.\n\nThompson said the survey was developed for two purposes, the first being \"to help guide the fitness industry.\"\n\nAlthough most of the industry is \"commercial properties,\" the survey is also helpful to community-based organizations, corporate wellness programs and medical fitness centers.\n\n\"They need some direction as to what will be the next trend in the industry so that when they use their valuable resources for something, they know it's going to work,\" Thompson said.\n\n\"We also do it from the perspective of people who use the gym, the clients,\" he said. \"It helps them identify gyms across the country that are offering the best kinds of exercise programs.\"\n\nThree new trends found a place on the top 20 list: \"licensure for fitness professionals\", \"core training\" and \"sport-specific Training.\" Licensure refers to the general trend toward more regulation of fitness professionals, such as personal trainers. Core work stresses strength and conditioning of the stabilizing muscles of the abdomen, thorax and back. Sport-specific exercising is usually geared toward younger athletes and focuses on a single sport, such as tennis or boxing.\n\nMeanwhile, \"work-site health promotion\" (which ranked 16th in last year's survey) and \"outcomes measures\" (previously 18th) fell from the top 20 list. In other words, incentive programs in employer-based health care benefits plans and comparison measurements to improve performance are no longer fashionable among the gym set.\n\nOne of the biggest surprises on the 2018 list was the \"re-emergence of group exercise programs,\" said Thompson, who remembers \"back in the day when that was all we did.\"\n\nPersonal training, which was introduced around 2000, reduced the popularity of group training, he noted. However, after the recession, less expensive group training sessions re-emerged and apparently continue to thrive. \"It's got to help increase revenue and decrease expenses,\" Thompson said.\n\nAnother trend for 2018 will be older adults being welcomed back into fitness clubs.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMost gyms \"still see their greatest revenue source as the 25- to 35-year-old age bracket,\" Thompson said.

The one you can stick with long-term, as it's not going to be quick or easy for most people. This is especially true for men, as this is often the last place on their body where they lose weight. In terms of specific exercise recommendations, three top trainers shared the advice they give their A-list clients. Gunnar Peterson, who trains Hollywood actors and professional athletes including the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers, advocates a comprehensive lifestyle approach that includes clean eating, adequate sleep, stress management, plenty of hydration, and sprint work mixed with steady-state cardio on alternate days to optimize fat burning. Sprint work, also known as high-intensity interval training, involves alternating periods of maximum effort with periods of recovery (not be confused with rest). The duration of sprints can increase and recovery periods can decrease as your fitness levels improve. Steady-state cardio involves working out at approximately 65% to 85% of your maximum heart rate for at least 30 minutes. What sets apart the 'Biggest Losers' who keep off the weight medicine ball rotations, One exercise Peterson does not recommend for reducing love handles is side bends with heavy weights. This type of exercise can actually exacerbate the appearance of love handles by increasing the size of the underlying external oblique muscles. Instead, he recommends working all of the abdominal muscles, not just the obliques, in multiple planes of motion. Exercises that reach those areas include wood chops medicine ball slams (at a variety of angles) and banded overhead extensions side to side and back to front. Ami Jampolis, a top San Francisco Bay Area trainer (and, full disclosure, my sister), recommends high-intensity circuit training several times a week to build or maintain calorie-burning muscle, along with several days of steady-state cardiovascular training. High-intensity circuit training involves alternating strength training exercises (such as a pushup) and short bouts of cardiovascular exercises (such as jumping jacks), with minimal rest in between. This type of training is gaining popularity for its fast pace and time efficiency and can be done at home or at a gym that specializes in this type of training. For homing in on the oblique muscles, Jampolis agrees with Peterson about avoiding side bends with weights. Instead, she suggests two very simple yet effective exercises that don't seem to have the bulking effect on the oblique abdominal muscles: side planks and bicycles . Both can be done anywhere and don't require any equipment.

Although their approaches may vary, professionals agree with the popular saying \"abs are made in the kitchen, not the gym.\" If you really want to lose your love handles, start by finding a diet plan that works for you and that you can stick with long-term, and then build in an exercise program that works with your current fitness level, exercise preference, budget and schedule. How to do a side plank: Lying on your side, lift your body onto your forearm, keeping hips, feet and shoulders stacked over one another. Aim to hold this position for as long as possible, increasing the time as you get stronger. Make sure not to collapse into your upper back. If your balance is a little off, you can place one foot in front of the other for more stability. Switch sides and repeat three times. As you advance, you can drop your hips to the floor and then bring them back up to the side plank position 15 to 20 times and repeat three sets per side. How to do bicycles: Lie on your back with both knees bent at a 90-degree angle and place your hands behind your head. Fully extend one leg out about 6 inches above the ground, bringing your opposite elbow to the opposite knee. With control, bring the extended leg in and extend the other leg out, simultaneously bringing the other elbow to the opposite knee. Make sure to twist from your stomach and not your neck. Control is key on this exercise; speed is not your friend. Aim for switching every two seconds. Aim for three sets of 60 (30 per leg).", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/01/health/love-handles-exercise-jampolis/index.html", "published": "2018-02-01T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why intense workouts are leading to a life-threatening condition", "text": "(CNN) When Christopher Michael Everett went to his first SoulCycle class, he gave it his all. He sat in the front of the class, cranked the resistance on his bike and started pedaling.\n\nWithin the first five to 10 minutes, his thighs began to hurt and feel abnormal. But he powered through the pain and stuck it out until the end of the class.\n\n\"They say go big or go home. I probably should have went home,\" said Everett, a 33-year-old actor in Los Angeles.\n\nFor the rest of the day, he felt OK, but the following night was marred by excruciating thigh pain. Unable to sleep, he searched for \"Spin class and sore legs\" and came across a personal account written by a woman who needed to go to the hospital after a cycling class for a condition called rhabdomyolysis.\n\nRhabdomyolysis leads muscle tissue to break down and release a harmful protein into the bloodstream. Everett recognized the symptoms she mentioned, such as soreness, swollen thighs, nausea and an inability to bend the knees. He had all of them except dark brown urine , which he was not about to wait for, he said.\n\nEverett immediately went to the ER and was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis. He stayed in the hospital for a week.\n\nWhat is rhabdomyolysis?\n\nRhabdomyolysis quite literally means \"breakdown of muscle,\" said Dr. Derek Fine, associate professor of medicine and interim chief of nephrology at Johns Hopkins Medicine. When the muscle breaks down, it releases myoglobin, a protein that can poison the kidneys, into the bloodstream.\n\nThe condition is caused by any type of trauma to the muscle. There are also toxins in some medications and illicit drugs that can cause it, he said. The first descriptions of the condition were among people who had been trapped under bombed buildings during World War II, Fine said.\n\nRecently, strenuous exercise has been popping up as another common culprit, seen in people who do activities like Spinning, P90X, CrossFit, weightlifting and running.\n\n\"I've had patients come in who can't walk. They can't get out of bed. They call 911 because their muscles don't work,\" Fine said.\n\nIn rhabdomyolysis cases that are easier to treat, the patient is given fluids to rehydrate and released from the hospital after a few days of monitoring, Fine said.\n\nEverett said he was hooked up to an IV and pumped with fluids for seven days to flush out the toxins in his kidneys. He was not released until his levels of CPK -- creatine phosphokinase, an enzyme that leaks into the blood when muscle tissue is damaged -- were normal.\n\nWorst-case scenario\n\nIf the condition is really severe, the kidneys may shut down, and the patient could end up on dialysis. With kidney failure comes the risk of an overload of potassium in the body, which could lead to abnormal heart rhythms and death.\n\nIn April, the American Journal of Medicine released a study on three cases of rhabdomyolysis that were caused by Spinning classes. In one case, a 33-year-old kindergarten teacher was put on dialysis when she had kidney failure and experienced fluid overload from her hydration treatment.\n\n\"It's tough to tell somebody who's 33 years old, 'I need to start you on dialysis.' And so you treat them with a lot of fluids, and you hopefully get them to the point where their kidneys open up and they start getting rid of the toxins and they don't have to go on dialysis,\" said Dr. Alan Coffino, a nephrologist and chairman of medicine at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and a co-author of the study. He treated the 33-year-old. \"In her case, we had to pull the plug and put her on dialysis.\"\n\nAfter two weeks, her kidneys opened up, and she was released from the hospital.\n\nAnother potential symptom of rhabdomyolysis is compartment syndrome, Coffino said, which is when muscles swell and are unable to expand. In some cases, surgery is needed to release pressure from the muscle.\n\nEverett said the swelling of his thighs concerned the doctor. \"He was like, 'if your thighs get any more swollen, we're going to have to cut those open,' \" he said. But the swelling did not increase, and Everett was able to avoid surgery.\n\nHow to avoid rhabdomyolysis\n\nPeople who work out regularly can get rhabdomyolysis, Coffino said, as well as those who don't exercise often. Those who are fit typically get it if they push themselves too hard or if they try a new exercise that works a different muscle group. The study he co-authored points out that of the 46 people documented in medical literature who got rhabdomyolysis from a Spin class, 42 developed it after their first class.\n\nEverett worked out every two to three days and considers himself fit, but he had never taken a Spin class before.\n\n\"I just wish SoulCycle would have said at the beginning of the class, 'if you work out too hard, this can happen to you,' \" Everett said. Its been one month since he was hospitalized, and his legs are still sore.\n\nSoulCycle has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nAlthough any type of extreme exercise can lead to the condition, the popularity of Spinning is what concerns Dr. Maureen Brogan, associate professor of medicine at New York Medical College, nephrologist at Westchester Medical Center and the lead author of the study.\n\n\"I mean, Spinning, you burn 600 calories in an hour, and you lose up to a liter an hour of sweat,\" Brogan said. \"Six hundred calories is like running six miles. So if you're not conditioned, you wouldn't just run six miles.\"\n\nOne of her patients developed rhabdomyolysis after spending only 15 minutes on a bike.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nRhabdomyolysis can occur at any age and in both men and women. In Brogan's Spinning study, it was more common in females, but that's because more women tend to participate in the exercise, she said.\n\nTo avoid the condition, it is important to be slow and gradual when beginning a new type of workout, she said. When going to a class, you should tell the instructor if you are new, and make sure to hydrate before, during and after exercising.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications can be damaging to the kidneys, so they shouldn't be taken after an intense workout, Brogan said. If someone does develop rhabdomyolysis, it could worsen their condition.\n\n\"It's better just to err on the side of caution and take things slowly,\" Brogan said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/26/health/rhabdomyolysis-spin-class-explainer/index.html", "published": "2017-07-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How an overweight shelter dog saved Eric O'Grey's life", "text": "(CNN) Life as a 340-pound man had become unmanageable for Eric O'Grey.\n\nWhen he wasn't traveling for work as a salesman for GE, the 51-year-old rarely left his San Jose, California, apartment.\n\nHe took insulin for type 2 diabetes and about 15 other medications, including anti-depressants and weight-loss drugs.\n\n\"My entire life was an exercise in minimizing my movement.

And he saw former President Bill Clinton on the news talking about his new \"plant-based\" diet.\n\nThe doctor recommended a whole foods, plant-based diet like Clinton's. She told O'Grey to throw out everything in his pantry that wasn't on her list.\n\nBut she also said something that shocked him. She ordered him to adopt a shelter dog and walk him twice a day for 30 minutes.\n\n\"I said, 'Why a dog? Can I adopt a cat instead?'

The most common misconception by far, was that fat is converted to energy. The problem with this theory is that it violates the law of conservation of matter, which all chemical reactions obey.\n\nSome respondents thought fat turns into muscle, which is impossible, and others assumed it escapes via the colon. Only three of our respondents gave the right answer, which means 98% of the health professionals in our survey could not explain how weight loss works.\n\nSo if not energy, muscles or the loo, where does fat go?\n\nThe enlightening facts about fat metabolism\n\nThe correct answer is that fat is converted to carbon dioxide and water. You exhale the carbon dioxide and the water mixes into your circulation until it's lost as urine or sweat.\n\nIf you lose 10 pounds of fat, precisely 8.4 pounds comes out through your lungs and the remaining 1.6 pounds turns into water. In other words, nearly all the weight we lose is exhaled.\n\nThis surprises just about everyone, but actually, almost everything we eat comes back out via the lungs. Every carbohydrate you digest and nearly all the fats are converted to carbon dioxide and water. The same goes for alcohol.\n\nProtein shares the same fate, except for the small part that turns into urea and other solids, which you excrete as urine.\n\nThe only thing in food that makes it to your colon undigested and intact is dietary fibre (think corn). Everything else you swallow is absorbed into your bloodstream and organs and, after that, it's not going anywhere until you've vaporised it.\n\nKilograms in versus kilograms out\n\nWe all learn that \"energy in equals energy out\" in high school. But energy is a notoriously confusing concept, even among health professionals and scientists who study obesity\n\nThe reason we gain or lose weight is much less mysterious if we keep track of all the kilograms, too, not just those enigmatic kilojoules or calories.\n\nAccording to the latest government figures, Americans consume 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and beverages every day. Of that, 430 grams (about 15 ounces) is solid macronutrients , 17 grams (0.6 ounces) is fibre and the remaining 3.11 kg (110 ounces) is water\n\nWhat's not reported is that we inhale more than 660 grams (23 ounces) worth of oxygen, too, and this figure is equally important for your waistline.\n\nIf you put 3.55 kg (125 ounces) of food and water into your body, plus 660 grams of oxygen (23 ounces), then 4.2 kg (148 ounces) of stuff needs to come back out, or you'll gain weight. If you're hoping to shed some weight, more than 4.1kg will have to go.\n\nThe 430 grams (15.2 ounces) of carbohydrates, fats, protein and alcohol most Americans eat every day will produce exactly 770 grams (27.1 ounces) of carbon dioxide plus 290 grams (10.2 ounces) of water (about one cup) and about 31 grams (1.1 ounces) of urea and other solids excreted as urine.\n\nAn average 75kg (165 pound) person's resting metabolic rate (the rate at which the body uses energy when the person isn't moving) produces about 590 grams (21 ounces) of carbon dioxide per day. No pill or potion you can buy will increase that figure, despite the bold claims you might have heard.\n\nThe good news is that you exhale 200 grams (7 ounces) of carbon dioxide while you're fast asleep every night, so you've already breathed out a quarter of your daily target before you even step out of bed.\n\nEat less, exhale more\n\nSo if fat turns into carbon dioxide, could simply breathing more make you lose weight? Unfortunately not. Huffing and puffing more than you need to is called hyperventilation and will only make you dizzy, or possibly faint. The only way you can consciously increase the amount of carbon dioxide your body is producing is by moving your muscles.\n\nBut here's some more good news. Simply standing up and getting dressed more than doubles your metabolic rate. In other words, if you simply tried on all your outfits for 24 hours, you'd exhale more than 1,200 grams (42 ounces) of carbon dioxide.\n\nMore realistically, going for a walk triples your metabolic rate, and so will cooking, vacuuming and sweeping\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMetabolising 100 ounces of fat consumes 290 ounces of oxygen and produces 280 ounces of carbon dioxide plus 110 ounces of water. The food you eat can't change these figures.\n\nTherefore, to lose 100 ounces of fat, you have to exhale 280 ounces of carbon dioxide on top of what you'll produce by vaporising all your food, no matter what you eat.\n\nAny diet that supplies less \"fuel\" than you burn will do the trick, but with so many misconceptions about how weight loss works, few of us know why.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/26/health/lose-weight-where-does-it-go-partner/index.html", "published": "2018-03-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ways to make someone feel loved, besides saying it", "text": "Story highlights Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures, experts say\n\nCooking for others can be viewed as a nurturing act that comes with the benefit of increased happiness\n\n(CNN) We say it before we end a phone call. We type it in our texts. It's the last words we speak before we say good night. \"I love you\" is possibly the most popular three-word phrase in the world, spoken millions of times every day.\n\n\"I love you\" translates intimacy between ourselves and others, but the expression is so common that it can lack the meaning it's intended. When saying and hearing it becomes automatic and expected, its power becomes dulled in our brain's limbic system, where we process love.\n\nPsychologist Abraham Maslow created a \"hierarchy of needs\" that ranks what humans are motivated to achieve, with love cited as a basic need after safety, food and shelter. A human's need for love carries a weight within us that isn't always an emotion. It can be an overall warmth, a deep sense of belonging, an underlying connectedness or confirmation of adoration between people.\n\nStill how do we arrive at a loving state?\n\nResearchers from Penn State University found that feeling loved isn't just about saying or hearing \"I love you.\" Feeling loved is often conveyed through small gestures. According to a recent study, behavioral expressions trump verbal ones when it comes to transmitting that loving feeling. \"It is possible for people to feel loved in simple, everyday scenarios,\" explained the study's lead researcher, Zita Oravecz. \"It doesn't have to be over-the-top gestures.\"\n\nRead More\n\nHere are easy and effective ways to communicate \"I love you.\" Read: Valentine's Day: Managing the pressure Give a small, personalized gift Gifts are common enough that they can become as generic an exchange as \"I love you\" -- but not if you consider the receiver and tailor it to them.

One study found evidence that offering food is seen as a form of affection and sharing food an indicator of love.

Making food as way to express love, explained dating expert and author James Michael Sama, \"brings people together in gatherings and celebrations, and can be used as a bonding experience with cooking and sharing.\" This combination of doing an altruistic, creative act while fulfilling someone's need to eat is mutually good for well being and feeling loved.

I'm supposed to know how to do this.\"\n\nBut some contestants discovered for themselves the key to keeping their weight down long after the cameras turned off, according to a study published Monday.\n\nSix years after appearing on the show, a group of 14 contestants had kept off a median 13% of their original body weight. The researchers split the group in two -- the \"maintainers,\" who had kept a substantial amount of the weight off, and the \"regainers,\" who did not -- and looked at what set them apart.\n\n\"Did they cut more calories from their diet ... or did they become more physically active?\" asked study author Kevin Hall , a senior investigator with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\n\nHall had been \"puzzled by how quickly the contestants were losing weight.\" So he contacted the show's physician and began studying the season eight contestants.\n\nEarly on, Hall observed that weight loss was better predicted by food intake, not physical activity alone. But in the long term, the opposite was true.\n\n\"You have to be very physically active in order to keep the weight off,\" Hall said.\n\nThe \"maintainers,\" who kept off about 25% of their preshow weight on average, increased their physical activity by roughly 160% from before the competition. Those who regained the weight increased their activity only 34%. They were 1.1% heavier on average than their original weight.\n\nThe researchers couldn't find any major differences between the food intake of both groups; both cut their calories by about the same amount.\n\n\"While we know that the most important aspect of helping one lose weight is the dietary intake, that is pretty much reversed when it comes to weight loss maintenance,\" said Dr. Jennifer Kraschnewski , associate professor of medicine and public health sciences at the Penn State College of Medicine. She was not involved in the study.\n\nHall's findings echo previous studies that promote more exercise for long-term weight loss maintenance. However, experts caution that doesn't mean people can neglect their diets in the long run, either.\n\nTo maintain the weight loss, Hall's team estimated that contestants would need to engage in 80 minutes of moderate activity or 35 minutes of vigorous activity each day beyond what they were doing at baseline.\n\nThe researchers didn't observe the contestants working out directly. They used tools like traceable water molecules to figure out how much energy was expended -- the \"gold standard\" measurements in this type of research, Kraschnewski said. Many larger studies have instead asked people to self-report how much they exercised, which can be riddled with errors.\n\nThis method, however, was not able to tell how much of the physical activity was due to normal daily activities -- like cleaning the house or walking the dog -- versus following a workout plan, Hall said.\n\nPart of the reason the contestants' weight rebounded was because of \"metabolic slowing,\" Hall said. As contestants lost weight during the competition, their bodies burned fewer calories than expected.\n\n\"This can make it more difficult to lose weight and is another hurdle to overcome,\" Kraschnewski said. After going on a very low-calorie diet, \"the body's mechanisms kick in to preserve body mass at all costs.\"\n\nSix years later, however, the contestants' resting metabolisms still hadn't sped back up, Hall showed in a study last year.\n\nThis is a stark difference from people who have had gastric bypass surgery for weight loss, whose metabolisms may speed back up in a year's time, Kraschnewski said. Researchers are trying to figure out why this is -- and it may have something to do with the intricate connections between the gut, brain and hormones that regulate hunger, Kraschnewski added.\n\nFor Hall, metabolic changes are just one part of the puzzle. Genetics may also play a role, as well as social factors that can make it hard for some people to incorporate so much exercise in their daily lives.\n\n\"To do that requires a huge investment of time and energy,\" he said. \"The bar is set very high for those folks to be able to maintain the weight loss without surgery or drugs.\"\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nHall added that it's not necessarily those who were most physically active during the competition who kept it up six years later.\n\n\"You can't really reproduce the expectation that those individuals must have had on the show to lose weight -- the pressure,\" Kraschnewski said.\n\n\"The take-home point here is that obesity really is a disease,\" she said. \"It's not something that you can treat once and will cure it.

It's common for one partner to be unhappy, feel disconnected or feel that their needs for intimacy aren't being met.\n\nBut rather than communicate about it, that partner may open up a metaphorical window with someone else and begin an affair. By the time the couple comes to therapy, the affair itself becomes the main topic, and its underlying causes are often ignored.\n\nThe same scenario rings true for other sources of contention, from financial disagreements to sexual concerns. It's clear that couples shouldn't wait until they're in crisis mode to come to therapy, but what should they do?\n\nWhen is the right time to see a therapist?\n\nCouples should seek therapy long before they think they \"need\" to. Most experts believe that therapy can be an important part of your relationship. \"Most issues within a couple start small and then grow in size when they don't get resolved. This is where therapy can help, by giving tools and techniques to improve conflict resolution,\" explained Kristie Overstreet, a licensed mental health counselor. \"The majority of couples that I work with say that they should have started therapy years earlier.\"\n\n\"There are three sides to every story: his side, her side and the truth,\" psychotherapist Kimberly Resnick Anderson agreed. \"An objective third party can be just the ticket when couples feel they can no longer communicate effectively.\"\n\nRather than viewing therapy as the solution to a crisis, look at it as an integral aspect of a healthy life, suggested Ashley N. Grinonneau-Denton, marriage and family therapist.\n\n\"Every couple should take preventive measures to maintain health in their relationship, just like going to the gym,\" she said. \"If couples don't work their relational and emotional 'muscles,' they become un-toned, weak and create more of a chance of damage being done to their relationship.\"\n\nWhat happens during couples therapy?\n\nAlthough every therapist is different, there are some commonalities. The first session typically involves the therapist getting to know you, discussing the areas of the relationship they hope to improve and setting goals.\n\nSome, but not all, therapists will assign homework for the couples to work on before the next session. \"Ideally, most of the work gets done, in my experience, outside of my office,\" psychotherapist Samantha Manewitz said.\n\nWhat problems can benefit from therapy?\n\nCouples come to therapy for any number of reasons, but in my experience, in addition to infidelity, the greatest issues include sex, communication, money and major life changes such as getting married or starting a family. Couples therapy is also a good idea if one of you is coping with an issue that might be affecting your relationship (such as depression) or simply if you're feeling stuck and stagnant in your relationship.\n\nTherapy can provide a safe space to talk about sensitive topics such as sex. \"Just like folks can get caught in a negative relational cycle, couples can often also get stuck in a negative sexual cycle,\" said Michael Moran, a certified sex therapist. \"I tell couples that when the sex they're having is worth having, they'll have more of it. And so we need to explore what blocks exist to creating that place between them.\"\n\nCommunication is also a big concern for couples. But simply talking with each other more isn't the answer. \"There is communication, and then there's effective communication,\" explained Sara Nasserzadeh, a psychologist. \"Both parties need to feel heard, soothed, respected and cared for first. We analyze old communication patterns and then replace them with feasible and more effective ones. These are all worked out collaboratively with the couple and within the context of their everyday life.\"\n\nYou might also consider couples therapy to help support you at times of major life change and transition. \"Getting married, becoming parents for the first time, moving, changing jobs, losing jobs, becoming empty-nesters, coping after extramarital affairs, recovering from addiction, caring for aging parents -- all of these transitions can destabilize a couple's equilibrium,\" Anderson said. \"Therapy affords couples an opportunity to negotiate these transitions with as little disruption as possible and to explore and honor what a particular transition means to each partner.\"\n\nAnd don't discount the value of couples therapy in helping you and your partner dig yourselves out of a rut.\n\n\"Therapy allows couples to talk through their feelings and articulate how their relationship may not be meeting their expectations,\" said James C. Wadley, a licensed counselor. \"More often than not, there is some common ground that may have enabled them to be in the relationship. 'Feeling stuck' can shift if both parties are willing to compromise in a way so that individual needs are met.\"\n\nWhat if one partner refuses to go?\n\nThis is a fairly common scenario in couples therapy. How you approach it can make a difference. \"Talk with your partner extensively about why you're feeling you'd like to get into couples therapy,\" Moran said. \"Don't just spring it on them and insist they go.\"\n\nIf they're still hesitant, remember that you can attend therapy on your own. This alone may have a beneficial effect.\n\n\"Instead of waiting for the other person who doesn't want to go to therapy to change, therapy can help strengthen your own self-improvement and personal growth,\" said Marissa Nelson, a marriage and family therapist. The hesitant partner may become impressed by these positive changes and decide to pursue therapy after all.\n\nIf you think your own experiences with therapy have piqued your partner's curiosity, let them know that can see the therapist individually as well. \"Often, by letting them know a safety zone will be created, where their voice is heard and fault or blame isn't the goal, the hesitant partner might feel safe to come in,\" psychotherapist Constance DelGiudice explained.\n\nHow do you know if your therapist is a good fit?\n\nIt helps to do your research before choosing a couples therapist, but the truth is that you won't really know whether they're the right for you and your partner until you get together.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"I often arrange a phone call first with clients to make sure we are potentially a good fit,\" Nasserzadeh said. \"Once you meet, pay attention to the therapist's communication style, the rational behind their questions and their general approach. \"Any homework they assign should be explained clearly and makes sense to you and your line of logic.\"\n\nHow long should therapy last?\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It really depends on the couple and the issues they're working through. For some couples, a few sessions may be all they need to jump-start their relationship, while others may remain in therapy for years.\n\nIn general, it's a good idea to see a therapist together until you've met your goals and feel confident that you've gained the skills necessary to navigate the ups and downs of your relationship.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/26/health/couple-therapy-kerner/index.html", "published": "2017-07-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Leukemia: Could germ-free childhoods could trigger illness?", "text": "(CNN) Germ-free childhoods followed by infections later in life can trigger the onset of childhood leukemia, a new study suggests.\n\nThe first step is a genetic mutation before birth that predisposes a child to the risk of developing this form of leukemia. The second step is exposure to certain infections later in childhood, after clean early childhoods that limited exposure to infections.\n\nMore specifically, children who grew up in cleaner households during their first year and interacted less with other children are more likely to develop acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the paper says.\n\nThe author, Institute of Cancer Research Professor Mel Greaves, suggests the cancer could be preventable.\n\nGreaves reviewed more than 30 years of research, including his own, on the genetics, cell biology, immunology, epidemiology and animal modeling of childhood leukemia and reached this conclusion. Greaves said he had long wondered \"why or how otherwise healthy children develop leukaemia and whether this cancer is preventable.\"\n\n\"This body of research is a culmination of decades of work, and at last provides a credible explanation for how the major type of childhood leukaemia develops,\" he said in a statement. \"The research strongly suggests that (this cancer) has a clear biological cause, and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed.\"\n\nHowever, other experts warn that more specifics needs to be confirmed and emphasize that hygiene and safety are still crucial.\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia , known as ALL, is a form of blood cancer that is most often diagnosed in children ages zero to 4 years old, though older children and adults can also be diagnosed. It develops quickly, over days or weeks, building up in the blood and spreads to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. The main form of treatment is chemotherapy.\n\nRates of the disease are increasing globally. One study estimated there were 53,000 cases worldwide in 2016. Around 5,960 new cases of ALL are estimated to occur in the United States in 2018, with 1,470 deaths according to the American Cancer Society. Each year, around 810 people are diagnosed in the UK , according to Cancer Research UK.\n\nWhile a genetic mutation plays a role in predisposing someone to the disease, just 1% of children born with this mutation go on to develop the disease, according to the paper. Rates are more common in advanced, affluent societies, which suggests the second step could be caused by factors relating to modern life.\n\nPrevious claims have linked electromagnetic waves and other environmental factors to the disease, but Greaves dismissed this link in his paper.\n\nThe body of research \"busts some persistent myths about the causes of leukaemia, such as the damaging but unsubstantiated claims that the disease is commonly caused by exposure to electro-magnetic waves or pollution,\" said Greaves.\n\nGreaves instead believes that when a baby is exposed to infections during its first year, its immune system is strengthened. But later infections, without the initial priming, can trigger leukemia in those with the genetic mutation.\n\nPopulation studies have found that early exposure to infection in infancy such as day care attendance and breastfeeding can protect against ALL, probably by priming the immune system, according to the study.\n\nGreaves emphasized that infection as a cause applies only to ALL. Other types of leukemia, including infant leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia, probably have different causal mechanisms.\n\n\"Preventing childhood leukaemia would have a huge impact on the lives of children and their families in the UK and across the globe,\" said Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research, London.\n\nHowever, other experts are more cautiously hopeful, emphasizing that genetics and pure chance are still significant factors for developing ALL.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"If we could stop this type of leukaemia from happening in the first place it would be enormously exciting, but many more questions still need to be answered in the research lab before we will know for sure whether that could become a reality,\" said Alasdair Rankin, director of research at blood cancer charity Bloodwise.\n\n\"There is no proven link yet with a specific infection,\" said Dr. Donna Lancaster, consultant pediatric oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. \"This [new study] still needs further investigation and any exposure of young children to infection has to be balanced with the risk of the infection.\n\nSheena Cruickshank of the British Society for Immunology also pointed to the potential risk of exposing children to infections, emphasizing that hygiene and safety are still crucial to maintain.\n\n\"It's also important to remember that infections themselves can pose a significant risk for young babies with a developing immune system,\" said Cruickshank in a statement. \"Parents should not be unduly alarmed by this review.\"\n\nThe research may be a step toward developing preventative measures. However, Charles Swanton, chief clinician of Cancer Research UK, stressed that the causes and prevention methods are still unconfirmed.\n\n\"This research sheds light on how a form of childhood blood cancer might develop, implicating a complex combination of genetics and early exposure to germs, dirt, and illness,\" Swanton said. \"We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/22/health/leukemia-clean-childhood-study-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-05-22T00:00:00"}, {"title": "5 ways to help girls be more confident", "text": "(CNN) If there's one quality I want my girls to have more than any other, it is confidence.\n\nI've seen how important it is in the workplace and in life: Confident people get what they want. They take risks. They are not afraid of failure.\n\nGrowing up as a perfectionist, somewhat fearful of both failure and success, I wish I had the confidence in my teens and early 20s that I have now.\n\nFor all these reasons, I was thrilled when one of my daughters, during the first grade, had to name five words to describe herself. Confident was on her list. I thought then and still think now, \"What can I do to make sure she feels that way when she is a teenager?\"\n\nJournalist, author and speaker Claire Shipman has some answers. In 2014, she and her co-author, Katty Kay, anchor of BBC World News America, published \"The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance -- What Women Should Know.\" The book resonated deeply with women and quickly became a bestseller.\n\nAs Shipman and Kay traveled the country to speak about the book, one of the most common questions they would get was from parents, women and men, who were concerned about their daughters.\n\n\" 'What about my daughter? I see this in my daughter,' \" Shipman said they would say. \"It was just this huge focus on young women and girls. 'What can I be doing with my girls, because I already see she's not this. She's experiencing that.' \"\n\nShipman, who spent a decade at CNN as a White House and international correspondent in the 1990s, said she and Kay did some research and found that there were plenty of books on the topic for parents but not as many specifically written for girls. So they decided to write one for girls in middle school, although it is applicable for girls up through high school, Shipman says.\n\nThey also commissioned an online poll, which backs up what other research has shown.\n\nBetween the ages of 8 and 14, girls' confidence drops by 30%, according to the survey of nearly 1,400 8- to 18-year-olds and their parents and guardians . The survey also found that three out of four teen girls worry about failing,\n\n\"We were surprised at how quickly, how deep that drop is,\" Shipman said. \"And especially because right until age 8, there's really no difference in confidence levels.\"\n\nSo how do we stop this troubling trend?\n\nI asked Shipman, a mom of two, for some advice -- advice she said she's using with her 13-year-old daughter, with good results.\n\n1. Help her get outside her comfort zone and take risks.\n\nOne of the most important things we can do as parents of daughters, Shipman said, is to help them get \"comfortable being uncomfortable.\" Shipman said she and Kay feel that if they do nothing else in this book but get girls to walk away and understand that it's cool to take risks, they will have succeeded.\n\nAs for how to do that, a parent can talk to their daughter about how they approach a risk and some of the ways they can support themselves. \"It's kind of counterintuitive, but just telling yourself 'Oh, you shouldn't be afraid of this' or 'there's nothing scary about it' or 'fake it until you make it,' that doesn't actually help. Risks can be scary,\" Shipman said.\n\nSo encourage your daughter and tell her, \"Yes, it's normal to feel afraid. This is a little frightening, but tell yourself 'I'm just going to do it afraid. I'm just going to do it anyway,' \" Shipman said.\n\n2. Have her keep a list of risks.\n\nHaving your daughter keep a list of the risks she has taken and how she worked through them can be a reminder of what she is capable of, Shipman said. The same holds true for failures: Listing their failures and how they tackled them can be incredibly empowering.\n\nAlso, have them keep a list of some stock phrases that they can tell themselves when they are in a bit of a frightening situation, such as \"I've done something like this before. I can do it. I've got it.\"\n\n3. Remind her of 'failure fixes.'\n\nOur girls need to know that failure will undoubtedly happen and that it's not something they can avoid. But knowing how to deal with it can help. \"We all need a cheat sheet to failure,\" Shipman and Kay write.\n\nThey offer a list of 10 \"failure fixes\" such as \"change the channel.\" Encourage your daughter to do anything that helps her get in a better place, whether that is reading a book, watching TV, listening to music or cuddling with a family pet. This will help distract her from what's happened and help her stop thinking about it over and over again.\n\nAnother fix is putting it in perspective. Shipman talks about an idea she and Kay heard from a middle school counselor, which she called a \"virtual hot air balloon ride.\" Help your daughter envision herself up in the sky with the clouds and looking down at the situation that happened. \"First, that lets her kind of literally put it in perspective, like, 'Wow, look, other things are going on,' and then see it from a different angle and talk about it that way.\"\n\nTrying to keep a sense of humor is also key. Of course, this is not easy when your daughter is melting down after what she considers the biggest failure of her life. But try to help her see that it could be much worse. \"Thoughts like 'at least I didn't forget to put on pants and go to school naked after our roof caved in' ... can remind you that it really could be worse!\" they write.\n\n4. Role model failure and struggle.\n\nOne of the more surprising results (at least to me) from the poll Shipman and Kay commissioned is that fathers seem to be better at recognizing a lack of confidence in their daughters than mothers: They were found to be 26% more likely to accurately estimate their child's confidence than moms were.\n\nHow could that be? Aren't mothers supposed to be the more intuitive parents? But as Shipman did her research, she found that mothers perhaps don't see their daughters' behavior as unusual.\n\n\"Perfectionism or worry about this or that, or sort of reticence to raise your hand, that's recognizable to us,\" Shipman said. \"Even if instinctively we know it's wrong, it doesn't seem odd, because we've probably experienced it. We may still do it, whereas I think fathers, who do have incredibly high expectations for their daughters, would be (saying) 'What is going on with my 9-year-old? Why was she this way a year ago, and now she's thinking she can't do anything?' They find it genuinely strange.\"\n\nThe takeaway is how influential role modeling can be for our kids. Let them see us, especially mothers, dealing with failure and struggle and taking risks.\n\n\"If we're going on, 'I'm so worried about this. I have to get it right,' it doesn't help them,\" Shipman said. She's tried to take this advice even more with her teenage daughter and \"lift the veil a little bit.\"\n\nWhen she's upset about something, for instance, such as having to rewrite a few chapters for a book, she lets her daughter see how she's feeling and then raises the question whether she's overreacting and figures out how she's going to deal with it -- all in front of her daughter.\n\n5. Remind her she doesn't have a problem.\n\nWith all the talk about girls and confidence, it's important to make it clear to our girls that it's not like they have a problem that needs to be fixed, Shipman said. Girls are the way they are for a host of reasons, including nature (brain biology) and nurture (society's different expectations for girls and boys.) They also often have a higher level of emotional intelligence.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"It's not like we want to churn out a bunch of girls who operate like boys,\" Shipman said. \"I think it would be wonderful for young women to understand much earlier on, essentially, the world doesn't operate like school.\"\n\nHelping girls understand at young ages what skills will be important later in life is key, including the ability to advocate for themselves and not worry about being people pleasers, Shipman said.\n\n\"Girls, even when they speak up in class or whatever it is, they want to please people, so I feel like the next hurdle is for girls to understand that they will not always please people. People won't always like them,\" Shipman said. \"And when they speak up, some people will like what they say, and others won't, and how do they develop that armor so that they say 'but that's OK, because I'm me.' \"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/21/health/girls-confidence-code-parenting/index.html", "published": "2018-05-21T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Move over, 'sit still'! Why kids need to move in school", "text": "(CNN) A few years ago, when my girls were in the second and third grades, they raved about the dance breaks they would occasionally have during the school day.\n\nTheir teachers would put on a video, which encouraged the kids to get up and dance, and then they'd get back to work.\n\n\"What a brilliant idea,\" I remember thinking at the time.\n\nMy kids' teachers were certainly not alone. More teachers are incorporating some form of movement into the school day, especially as the research is pretty clear: Physical activity in school leads to better cognitive performance and fewer behavioral issues, not to mention cutting down on stress and anxiety.\n\nGroups such as the National Association of Physical Literacy tout the importance of teaching kids to move while they're young so that they will make movement part of their lives when they grow up.\n\nIt all seems like a no-brainer, especially as research shows that childhood obesity seems to be getting worse . As former first lady Michelle Obama advocated, let's get our kids to move.\n\nThe challenge, though, is persuading school administrations to consistently make time for physical activity when they are pressed to meet stringent academic requirements and find the money to pay for some of the training.\n\nResearch: Physical activity benefits students\n\nJust as our schools teach math literacy and reading literacy, they can teach physical literacy, teaching children the basics of movement so that they can stay active for life, said Susan Kamin, chief wellness officer for the National Association of Physical Literacy.\n\nThe for-profit association provides in-person and online training to teachers and communities and provides \"BrainErgizer\" videos, five-minute movement videos developed in conjunction with the University of Connecticut based on research on what stimulates the brain.\n\nDr. John Ratey , an associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, says activity breaks during the school day create better learners because of the impact of movement on the brain.\n\n\"When you move, you stimulate all the nerve cells that we use to think with, and when you stimulate those nerve cells, it gets them ready to do stuff,\" said Ratey, an expert in neuropsychiatry and author of \"Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain\" who has spent the past 30 years focusing on the \"attention systems\" of the brain.\n\n\"When you exercise, you turn on the attention systems, so that means you're (paying) better attention, you're able to deal with more frustration, you're able to stay with it longer,\" he said. \"You're able to manipulate information by turning ... on the front part of our brain to make it work better, and that's really key and important in terms of taking in information as well as performing with it.\"\n\nA recent study, a review of 26 previous studies looking at the impact of physical activity on academic performance, found that kids who get extra physical activity in school do better in reading and math.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Pediatrics , involved more than 10,000 children between the ages of 4 and 13. It found that physical activity, especially physical education, improves behavior in classrooms and is a boost to academic achievement, especially math-related skills and reading.\n\n\"The research shows that it leads to better cognitive function for kids so they're going to have better results, academically,\" Kamin said. \"It's also going to help with behavioral issues in the classroom, because if kids are able to move, they're not going to have so much excess energy. They're going to be able to focus, and it's going to solve a lot of the sort of interpersonal issues that come up with kids as well, because they're going to have an opportunity to get that energy out.\"\n\nBreakthrough Magnet School, South, a pre-K through eighth-grade school in Hartford, Connecticut, is in its third year working with the National Association of Physical Literacy. The school had valued movement and mindfulness before, but since the partnership, the school has received additional training and is making physical literacy a key part of the classroom experience, Principal Julie Goldstein said.\n\n\"I think it really validates a lot of what teachers know: that students need movement, they need planned opportunities for movement and that it can be done in a pretty short, simple way throughout the day and that the benefits of it outweigh the little bit of planning that is necessary in the beginning to kind of get that structured,\" Goldstein said.\n\nHer third- and fourth-graders who are actively engaged in physical literacy are the highest-scoring students in math and literacy within the district, she said. Beyond the benefits academically, there are benefits outside the classroom. For this school year, not one student from this group has been referred to her office for a conversation with the principal. Before they started doing physical literacy, she might have had one or two office referrals every month, she said.\n\n\"This particular grade level is at the highest risk for misunderstandings, disagreements and even injuries at recess time, and we've had none, so the impact that it is has goes far beyond just the academic and the behaviors in the classroom,\" she said. \"Even during the unstructured times, they're better able to manage themselves, to play independently and to do that in a way so that the recess time actually serves them the way it's intended to, which is to give them time to play and have fun.\"\n\nUsing screens to get kids moving\n\nFour out of five elementary schools in the United States are using videos from the education company GoNoodle to promote physical activity in the classroom, the company says.\n\nThe concept is simple: Today's kids have grown up with screens, so GoNoodle tries to use entertaining videos, often about two minutes in length, that will get kids to move around and then either get back to their schoolwork or go off and play with friends.\n\nKC Estenson is the chief executive officer of GoNoodle, a for-profit company that makes money through relationships with partners who believe in the company's mission. (The videos are free for schools and parents, although teachers can pay for GoNoodle+, which for $10 a month gives them access to additional videos, games and classroom resources.)\n\nEstenson -- who is the former head of CNN Digital -- is a father of three who, like most parents, has struggled with how much time his kids, ages 8, 12 and 14, spend on screens during the day.\n\n\"GoNoodle gets kids to move. It gets them to be active,\" Estenson said. \"The entire purpose of this is a whole new interaction form with the screen, which is active engagement versus passive engagement, and most television and most of what's happening with the technology now of all ages is passive, binge viewing, hours spent just watching the screen and doing nothing else.\"\n\nThe key, he said, is making entertaining content that children (the target group is ages 5 to 12, grades K-6) will enjoy so much that they'll want to get up and dance or do yoga or even some form of meditation and mindfulness.\n\n\"And so starting from the earliest age ... we're putting positive associations between the right things that are available to them on these screens and hopefully giving them an awesome alternative to the junk food that's out there,\" said Estenson.\n\n'It really validates ... what teachers know'\n\nActive Schools, which was founded as part of Obama's Let's Move initiative, is a national movement, partnering with nonprofits and for profits to try to make physical education and physical activity a bigger part of the school day.\n\nThe goal is at least 60 minutes of activity per day, which is crucial especially since many kids don't get the play time children used to get outside of school decades ago. There are a variety of reasons why, including the widespread use of digital devices and a lack of access to and time for free play.\n\n\"One of the biggest pieces of feedback we get from schools in the field is, 'we are very busy places. We appreciate what everyone offers, but it's overwhelming. Can you make it easier for us to know what's available?' \" said Charlene Burgeson, executive director of Active Schools.\n\nStreamlining to make it less cumbersome for schools to learn what resources are available and what programs they can bring to their school is one challenge. The others are money, time and philosophy.\n\nSchools can't always find the funding to pay for formal training, videos and other programs that get kids moving. There is also the pressure of the clock and having enough time to work physical activity in when trying to meet the required academic standards and complete the curriculum.\n\n\"I know lots of teachers who say, 'Yeah, I wish I had more time to do this,' \" the National Association of Physical Literacy's Kamin said. Even in schools that can find the time, there is still some opposition because it's a departure from the way things used to be, she said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"It's a big change for some of the teachers. They're not sure that they want to make that leap. It's sort of 'if it's not broke, why fix it?' Yet the schools that have made the leap see tremendous results. So how do you move the needle?\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/03/health/children-movement-schools-classroom/index.html", "published": "2018-05-03T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Looking at children's programming through a #MeToo lens", "text": "(CNN) We are all familiar with the negative images of girls and women in movies and other media -- and how ubiquitous they are.\n\nFrom the physical portrayal of women as ultra-thin, super sexy and scantily clad to the sexualized roles they often play, it's enough to make you wish you could put your daughters in a bubble to shield them.\n\nOf course, you can't. Even that \"Prince Charming\" narrative, in which their lives are not complete until they meet the right guy and that guy decides to love them in return, is everywhere.\n\nBut what about the positive role models our girls are seeing? Certainly, the #MeToo movement has called attention to the need to create more substantial roles for women of all ages on the big and small screens and to get more women behind the scenes in director and screenwriting roles.\n\nEven before the past six months when women's voices have been heard in ways they haven't been before, there were signs -- exciting signs -- of shifting portrayals of young women, even in children's programming.\n\nResearch shows that kids develop stereotypes at early ages. A Common Sense Media analysis of more than 150 articles, interviews and books and other research found that kids between the ages of 7 and 10 start to attribute certain qualities to women and men, such as that women are emotional and men are aggressive.\n\nLet me say that one more time. Between 7 and 10.\n\nHelping young girls and boys during these ages see realistic portraits of girls and boys can have enormous benefits, which brings me to \"Andi Mack,\" Disney Channel's No. 1 show in video on demand. The show just wrapped its second season and has been renewed for a third.\n\nSofia Wylie, left, and Peyton Elizabeth Lee of \"Andi Mack\" on Disney Channel.\n\nThink about the storyline, which is uncharted territory for mainstream children's programming: The main character, Andi, learns that the person she thought was her older sister for 13 years is actually her mother and that the two people she thought were her parents are actually her grandparents. Andi grapples with these life-changing circumstances with the support of her two best friends: the gender-stereotype-bashing Buffy, who believes she is as strong -- or stronger -- than any of the boys, and Cyrus, who has only recently shared with his friends that he is gay.\n\nMy girls, ages 10 and 11, and I watch the show -- together -- every Friday night. We recently had a chance to sit down with the show's creator and three of its stars.\n\n'A girl can do anything a boy can do'\n\nTerrI Minksy, the creator and executive producer of \"Andi Mack,\" wanted to create a show that mothers could watch with their daughters. She said she didn't create the characters with female empowerment in mind but very much was focused on the point of view of the girl, because girlhood is when girls begin to get a sense of their own power or lack thereof.\n\n\"There's always this 'you can grow up to be whatever you want,' but we haven't seen a female president in the United States. We don't see female faces when you're looking at anything where decisions are being made,\" said Minsky, who made the pilot with a predominantly female team.\n\n\"I just feel like it has to start with the kids as represented in the shows as having the power over their world, and hopefully that translates to people watching it without specifically calling it female power.\"\n\nSofia Wylie plays Buffy, who tries out for and makes the boys' basketball team (she also ends up tutoring the captain of the team). Sofia, 14, believes that her character can serve as an empowering role model to girls who watch.\n\n\"I would definitely say Buffy sends a message that a girl can do anything a boy can do and there's really no difference,\" said Sofia, also an accomplished dancer who has performed on stage with Justin Bieber and on \"America's Got Talent.\"\n\nSofia Wylie with her military mom on the show \"Andi Mack.\"\n\n\"So many people say, 'Oh, yeah, boys are just like stronger,' and when a boy says that, I'm going to contain myself now,\" she says to laughter as she indicates how frustrated that statement makes her feel. \"It's not true. If a woman wants to put their mind to something, they can be just as intelligent and just as strong physically and mentally in every way. They can be even better than a man.\"\n\nEven today, in 2018, a woman who is competitive -- especially in the workplace -- may be viewed differently than a man. A man may be considered assertive, a woman aggressive. Sofia says her character tackles that double standard as well.\n\n\"People think if you're competitive, that means you're mean,\" she said. \"No, she's competitive for a separate reason, because she's been told that she has to be strong.\" In one episode, we learn that Buffy feels she needs to always be strong to help her cope when her mom, who is in the military, is away during months-long deployments.\n\nA story line with #MeToo resonance\n\nOne of the recurring storylines that also tackles gender stereotypes head-on is Andi's crush on the handsome, athletic and very popular Jonah Beck. During season one and the first half of season two, Andi is basically obsessed with Jonah. At some point, it appears they may actually be boyfriend and girlfriend in the way 13-year-olds innocently begin relationships. She makes him a bracelet. She beams when she sees him. But he never seems to truly understand Andi and never does for Andi all the things she does for him.\n\nAnd then, Andi has had enough. With the support of her friends Buffy and Cyrus and her mom, Bex, she finally decides to tell Jonah that she has been obsessed with him and that she can no longer continue doing what she has been doing. It is the moment when, I would argue, many women watching (and many who have experienced #MeToo moments) ask themselves, \"Why didn't I say that when I was in a similar situation?\"\n\n\" allowfullscreen>\n\nLilan Bowden, who plays Bex, Andi's independent and individualistic mother, says she wishes she had \"Andi Mack\" when she was a girl. Instead, the shows she watched all repeated the same story line: The girl has a crush on the boy, the boy finally says he likes her back, and they get together.\n\n\"That was the message that I felt like I received over and over again: Just do the nice thing. If you're nice and you keep being nice and you don't stop being nice, eventually, you'll get what you want,\" Bowden said. \"And to have that character to say, 'I was nice, and you didn't appreciate it because you're not nice enough back to me' was huge.\"\n\nLilan Bowden, right, plays Andi's mother on the show \"Andi Mack.\"\n\nMinsky said the episode was written more as a natural progression of Andi's character and less in response to the #MeToo movement.\n\nWhen Andi expresses herself to Jonah, she's the one who is in charge for the first time, said Minsky, who also created \"Lizzie McGuire,\" a live-action and animated series that was also a Disney Channel hit.\n\n\"It's always the girl giving and embarrassing herself and putting herself out there and taking chances, and the boy's sitting back, and you don't know how he feels ... and then she finally expresses herself, and he's like 'Oh, wow, I really enjoy that you're obsessed with me,' and I kind of feel, 'yeah, I bet you did.' \" (In another sign of the show's relatable nature, it tackles anxiety when Jonah has a panic attack after Andi tells him she is moving on.)\n\nPeyton Elizabeth Lee, who plays Andi, said she, Sofia and Bowden cheered when they read that episode because it was a sign that Andi was \"finally finding her voice.\"\n\n\"Because she's just been so caught up in 'Jonah's cute, and he's fun, and he has so many friends, and he's popular, and he's athletic and whatever,' but when it really comes down to it, he wasn't giving her enough credit for everything she was doing for him,\" said Peyton, 13, who has appeared on ABC's \"Scandal\" and \"Shameless\" on Showtime.\n\n\"I think she was realizing that she's worth more, so it was a really exciting thing ... where she's saying 'I was obsessed with you,' and it's Andi realizing that she doesn't need him to feel complete.\"\n\nGender equality in media? Long way to go\n\nThere is no question that we need to see more realistic and authentic female characters on television and in film.\n\nResearch commissioned by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in the Media in 2014 shows how far we need to go. It found that the percentage of female characters in the work force in TV and film was less than 25%, when women make up just about half of the actual work force.\n\nFictional male judges and lawyers outnumbered female characters in those same roles 13 to 1; the breakdown of men to women was 7.6 to 1 when it came to characters in computer science and engineering.\n\nWe know that when you see it, you can be it. In a survey of 1,000 women in the United States and the United Kingdom, conducted by the Davis Institute and J. Walter Thompson and unveiled in 2017, 71% of respondents in the US and 63% in the UK said that if we saw more corporate leader characters who were women, it would make it easier for women to become leaders in the corporate sector.\n\nSixty-four percent of respondents in the US and the UK said that seeing more female characters as politicians would make it easier for women to succeed in politics.\n\nBowden, who also regularly performs improv and sketch comedy, hopes shows like \"Andi Mack\" are a marker for what is to come.\n\nWhen she got to Hollywood and was auditioning, there was a very limited selection of roles for women, she said. \"It's almost like a paying of dues where ... you're pretty much just the eye candy,\" she said. \"I didn't want to be a model. I wanted to be an actor, but there's so many roles that are written for women where they just kind of pigeonhole you into being a model.\n\n\"This show is all these dynamic female characters that aren't relying on beauty at all, and that's not an experience I felt like I had when I was first auditioning,\" she said.\n\nWith surveys showing that girl confidence dips around puberty , having strong female early-teenage role models who speak truthfully and aren't afraid to stand up for what they believe can only be a positive.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"I think you can take so many things away (from the show) but just being confident in yourself,\" Sofia told my daughters. \"I think that's the best thing about all of our characters is, we're all ourselves.\"\n\nAdded Peyton, \"A lot of shows showcase if you're just nicer, it all works out. If you're nice, you get friends. You have a boyfriend, but it's just not like that, and you have to find that balance of being nice, but being careful. ... You have to figure out which way you want to go.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/02/health/childrens-programming-female-empowerment-role-models/index.html", "published": "2018-03-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Former NFLers call for end to tackle football for kids", "text": "Story highlights Former football players are supporting new education initiative, Flag Football Under 14\n\n\"Please don't let your children play football until high school,\" one Hall of Fame player said\n\n(CNN) Several former NFL players called Thursday for an end to tackle football for kids ages 13 and under.\n\nPro football Hall of Famers Nick Buoniconti and Harry Carson joined four-time Pro Bowl linebacker Phil Villapiano and researchers from Boston University to make the announcement.

The research included data from 39 separate research projects conducted between January 1990 and June 2016, with a total of 110,380 participants, all of whom were under 18 -- with some as young as 11.\n\nThe researchers focused on data since 2008 and found an increase in sexting among young people.\n\nThe increased number of young people involved in sending or receiving sexually explicit photographs or messages has corresponded with rapidly expanding access to cell phones.\n\nWith that trend in mind, the study's authors suggest that \"age specific information on sexting and its potential consequences should regularly be provided as a component of sex education.\"\n\nWhy sext?\n\nThe researchers found that younger people engage in sexting in large part as a way to begin exploring attraction to other people.\n\n\"As teens get older, we are going to see increasing numbers ... who sext. Just as we see with actual sexual behavior,\" said study co-author Jeff Temple, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Medical Branch.\n\n\"It's not terribly surprising considering as teens age, their interest in sexuality is heightened. They are trying to figure out who they are.\"\n\nKami Kosenko, a communications professor at North Carolina State University, agreed: \"As individuals become more comfortable talking about sex and interact with more potential sexual partners, we would expect to see them engage in more sexual communication, of which sexting is a part.\" Kosenko was not directly involved in the study.\n\nTeens sometimes 'assume safety'\n\nThe study predicts a similar upward trend in sexting among younger teens and preteens. Coupled with a lack of awareness of the risks involved, especially among younger children, that is a cause for concern, the researchers said.\n\nPreteens can be particularly vulnerable to the pitfalls of sexting. Relationships among tweens (children 10 to 12) are often short-lived, and that makes individuals more vulnerable to having sexts forwarded without consent or being subject to sextortion: the use of nude images and or videos as a form of threat or blackmail.\n\n\"As tweens and kid smartphone ownership gets younger and younger, we are going to see an increase in the number of teens who are sexting,\" Temple said.\n\nOn average, children in the study were 10.3 years old when they got their first smartphones.\n\nDanger also arises from messaging apps that give the impression that videos and images shared or stored are private, although this may not be the case.\n\n\"Teens can sometimes assume safety or security is embedded in these apps when it's not,\" said study co-author Sheri Madigan, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Calgary.\n\n\"Kids don't really have a clear understanding of cause and effect,\" Madigan said. \"When they send a picture, they may not recognize they cant get it back or that it is really up to the recipient to decide how they are going to treat that picture.\"\n\nKosenko said that \"with youth acquiring cell phones at younger and younger ages, we should be concerned about their digital and physical safety.\"\n\nPart of the problem lies in the children's brains, Madigan said. \"Younger teens who have less developed frontal lobes are less able to think through things than older teens. They are likely more vulnerable to being coerced into sexting or to participate in nonconsensual sexting.\"\n\nThere is little or no literature on tweens and sexting, according to Madigan, who suggests that it is important to do further research on the topic.\n\nNonconsensual sexting\n\nAccording to the study, 12.5% of young people -- or one out of every eight -- report that they have been forwarded a sext without consent from the sender and/or the receiver.\n\n\"That is why this concept of digital safety and security is so important: because we know that this is happening. We know that sexts are being forwarded without consent, so if parents are having conversations with their teens about sexting, they can talk about those potential risks,\" Madigan said.\n\nNonconsensual sexting can take a toll on a teen's health.\n\n\"If we look at things like sexual behavior with teens, if it's consensual and both teens wanted it and are OK with it, you are not going to see the negative psychological health. If it was nonconsensual or coerced, that is where you see the negative mental health problems, and we see the same thing with sexting,\" Temple said.\n\nAccording to the study, further research needs to be conducted on nonconsensual sexting \"to appropriately target and inform intervention, education, and policy efforts.\"\n\nWhat parents need to know\n\nJAMA Pediatrics defines sexting as \"the sending or receiving of nude or seminude images or sexually explicit text messages.\" This can happen voluntarily in a relationship or when a teenager is asked to \"prove\" how much they like someone. It can also happen without consent.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe biggest concern, according to the journal, is the possibility of photos or messages being spread to other people. Sexting can cause severe emotional distress, which is why it is important to talk with children about it. The researchers suggest:\n\nStart the discussion early with your kids using broad questions such as \"have you heard of sexting?\" By understanding what your child already knows, you can then frame your conversation.\n\nUse examples appropriate for your child's age. Be specific about the possible consequences of sexting. \"Parents should be proactive and not reactive,\" Madigan said.\n\nRemind your teenager of their own worth. Let them know that being pressured is not OK and that sexting is not a way to \"prove\" their love. \"If you have the conversation early and often, when problems arise, then kids know they can go to their parents and talk to them,\" Madigan said.\n\nBeing open and withholding judgment are keys to a successful interaction with a young person about sexting, Kosenko said.\n\n\"This means that demonizing sexting won't work. Also, don't assume that you are the expert on the subject or the one who should lead the discussion,\" she said.\n\n\"You might be tempted to tell your children to ask you if they have questions, but consider what can be gained by letting your children tell you what they know and think about sexting.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/26/health/youth-sexting-prevalence-study/index.html", "published": "2018-02-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Signs of ADHD can be different in girls", "text": "When asked to describe a typical child with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), most people would describe a young boy who climbs on things, is impatient and does not do what he is told.\n\nFew people would describe a bubbly young girl with lots of friends, who works hard to get good grades.\n\nIt may be, however, that the girl does experience ADHD symptoms that interfere with her daily life -- and that these symptoms are overlooked by the adults around her.\n\nUndiagnosed ADHD has long-term consequences including an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviours -- such as unprotected sex and substance use -- as well as academic underachievement and low self-esteem . Perhaps most alarmingly, girls who struggle with ADHD for a long period of time can suffer from mental health problems\n\nAs a psychologist in clinical practice, I used to see many older girls and adult women with ADHD who had already been prescribed medication to treat anxiety and depression. Early diagnosis then is vital.\n\nAssessment scales use data from boys\n\nIndividuals with ADHD exhibit three main clusters of symptoms: hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. Although three times as many boys are diagnosed with ADHD in childhood than girls, the diagnostic rates in adults are more equally divided between males and females. This suggests girls go unnoticed when they are younger.\n\nAs a disorder traditionally seen as affecting males, and with males referred more often for a diagnosis, research to assess ADHD has been based on samples largely consisting of boys. It has been argued that the rating scales developed to assess ADHD have been based on the behaviours observed in the mainly male research samples.\n\nADHD can look different in girls than boys. A boy who is hyperactive might have trouble sitting in his seat in the classroom -- so he sits with one knee on the seat and one foot on the floor. It is likely, given his constant shifting and unequal balance on the seat, that the back legs of the chair will eventually lift up and the chair pitch forward causing the boy to fall to the floor.\n\nIn contrast, a hyperactive girl may be out of her seat but have taken on the role of classroom helper, wandering around to different desks. A teacher completing a rating scale might rate the boy higher on hyperactive questions than the girl because the second example is not seen as disruptive. Thus, girls do not score as high as boys on these scales and are underrepresented because they do not meet criteria for a diagnosis.\n\nNot only do symptoms of ADHD look different in boys but boys also have a tendency to be more hyperactive and impulsive than girls. Because hyperactive and impulsive behaviours are more disruptive in the classroom, teachers are more likely to notice boys as a problem and refer them for attention challenges.\n\nLastly, symptoms of ADHD in girls are sometimes masked because they work hard to meet adult expectations. Without meaning to, adults have different expectations of girls than boys. Adults expect girls to be tidy and organized, achieve good grades and to be easygoing. In turn, girls are more likely to want to obey social norms and not cause trouble. They will work extra hard to achieve success by staying up late to finish homework or tidying their rooms when asked.\n\nSometimes, when adults encounter girls who have difficulty meeting their expectations but the girls are agreeable, they excuse the behaviours by describing the girls as \"ditzy,\" \"dramatic\" or \"artsy.\"\n\nSigns that your daughter might have ADHD\n\nThere are many symptoms of ADHD shared by both boys and girls. The following are examples of how they can manifest in girls:\n\nHomework takes longer than it should. She forgets about it or is distracted by surfing the internet or texting her friends and ends up staying up late the night before an assignment is due to finish it.\n\nShe is an inefficient student. While she appears to study for tests, her performance does not seem to match the time spent studying.\n\nShe has weak reading comprehension. She can get facts from a text but does not make links between the ideas she reads. She misses details in instructions on assignments and tests.\n\nShe struggles with friendships because she does not read social cues or follow conversations. Peers start to reject and isolate her or make fun of her.\n\nShe forgets things she needs (e.g. dance shoes or soccer cleats). This is a classic sign but agreeable girls with ADHD will often have friends or adults who compensate for them (for example sharing a pen because she doesn't have one).\n\nShe misplaces her things regularly (for example her phone, keys or bank card).\n\nShe talks, and talks and talks.\n\nShe does not run and climb about like boys but is the classroom helper and is social and chatty in class.\n\nShe has lots of friends because she is fun to be around but when she tries to organize activities she seems anxious and indecisive. Her friends help her make decisions, find her things and keep her organized.\n\nShe has great ideas and wants to start acting on them right away but does not finish projects or follow through.\n\nShe is chronically late or is not ready when she needs to be.\n\nShe channels hyperactivity by being involved in many extracurricular activities like swimming, school clubs and soccer.\n\nShe does not seem to learn from consequences.\n\nShe has wide swings in mood. One moment she is on top of the world and the next moment she is crushed because of a casual comment that is taken as harsh criticism.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIf you think your daughter might have ADHD, you should consult with a psychologist or pediatrician who is familiar with ADHD and can provide an in-depth assessment.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/27/health/girls-adhd-signs-partner/index.html", "published": "2017-11-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Tackling the relentless pressure to succeed that's driving girls to despair", "text": "(CNN) As a mom of two daughters, I'm mindful of how girls today have more opportunity than ever. In fact, I tell my girls this all the time: They can be anything they want and shatter any glass ceiling, even the highest one, the presidency.\n\nBe confident and speak up, and you can achieve great things, we tell our girls. You can play any sport, join any after-school club, volunteer for any cause and get the grades. In fact, girls are regularly outperforming boys in school and enrolling in higher numbers in college.\n\nIt's a great time to be a girl -- or is it? Because behind all these possibilities is a troubling development: Girls' anxiety and depression are climbing and increasingly turning tragic.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2015, the suicide rate for girls between the ages of 15 and 19 doubled, reaching a 40-year high in 2015, according to new data from the National Center for Health Statistics.\n\n\"I think no one can dispute the wholesale kind of collapse of girls' wellness right now,\" said bestselling author Rachel Simmons, who has been working with and doing research on girls for the past two decades.\n\n\"It's really a crisis. I don't think I'm overstating it. Everywhere I go, I hear about levels of anxiety that are so crippling that it makes it hard for teachers to teach, and we can't not pay attention to this anymore.\"\n\nSimmons points to the findings of a 2015 freshman survey by UCLA of 150,000 full-time students at more than 200 colleges and universities.\n\nRachel Simmons is author of \"Enough As She Is.\"\n\nTwice as many girls as boys reported that they felt depressed frequently or occasionally, and twice as many girls as boys said they were \"overwhelmed with all they had to do\" -- a 25% jump in the number of girls in both categories in just over 15 years, according to Simmons.\n\nWhat's behind these concerning numbers? As Simmons writes in her new book, \"Enough As She Is: How to Help Girls Move Beyond Impossible Standards of Success to Live Healthy, Happy, and Fulfilling Lives,\" girls are growing up with outsize expectations of personal and professional success. The pressure to be great at everything is causing them to feel less confident, more fearful of failure and more critical of themselves, Simmons says.\n\nGirls' psychology and culture on 'collision course'\n\n\"There is a deep mismatch in terms of what the culture is telling girls and their most vulnerable parts of their psychology,\" said Simmons, who is also co-founder of the national nonprofit Girls Leadership.\n\nGirls are socialized at a very young age to rely heavily on feedback from others. They grow up paying more and more attention to what other people think of them and whether they are measuring up to those external expectations.\n\nIn today's society, that relentless concern about pleasing others is on what Simmons calls a collision course with two cultural changes: the ubiquitousness of social media, which is exacerbating the need to perform, and heightened expectations of what it means to be a successful girl today.\n\n\"We're now giving girls access to STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). We're giving girls access to opportunities they've never had before. And we're not doing that and saying, 'Oh, you don't have to have a bikini body anymore. That's cool. You're good. You can look however you want to look,' \" Simmons said.\n\n\"No, we're saying 'keep your bikini body and become an engineering major and also have a totally lit Snapchat feed on a Saturday night,' and so that's exhausting, and I call that role overload and role conflict.\"\n\nSocial media alone becomes a \"virtual second shift\" for young girls, almost like a full-time job, as they spend more time on average on Instagram and Snapchat that boys do.\n\n\"Social media enables them to curate an exhausting range of identities -- jock, scholar, beauty queen, party girl, best friend, and on and on -- demanded by the new rules of girl success, crammed into a twenty-four-hour day,\" she writes in \"Enough As She Is.\"\n\nSimmons said she wishes she didn't have to write this book. In her bestseller \"The Curse of the Good Girl,\" published in 2009, she wrote about the need to teach girls how to take up space, find courage and be confident. But in her work with girls on college campuses and elementary, middle and high schools across the country, she started to see that the wellness piece was missing.\n\n\"Despite very high levels of achievement, girls were struggling with a sense of imposter syndrome, low lack of confidence, overthinking and an enduring belief that no matter how hard they tried, they were not enough of whatever it was,\" said Simmons, who has a young daughter of her own.\n\n\"Moreover, the terms of success that they had established for themselves were so kind of outsized and unrealistic and unhealthy that they were on this hamster wheel of trying to get something they were never going to get.\"\n\nSimmons said she has come to realize that in order to help girls become stronger and more confident, we have to attend to their emotional health. \"We never thought about girls' leadership as being integrated into their wellness, and ... that's the shift that's taking place, is that we need to start thinking about wellness in tandem with growing their confidence and growing their achievement.\"\n\nChanging how we teach girls\n\nTara Christie Kinsey , head of school at The Hewitt School, a girls' private school in New York City, and a former dean at Princeton University, said that what she and her colleagues in higher education have seen across college campuses for years are young girls with \"amazing ... paper resumes\" with all the right grades and SAT scores.\n\nIt \"looks amazing on paper, and yet the interior life of young women in particular was sorely lacking,\" said Kinsey, who has a daughter in the third grade and a son in the fifth grade.\n\nShe tells the story of meeting with a female college student when her then-5-year-old daughter burst through the office door, so excited to show her mom the contents of her kindergarten folder. When her daughter left, \"the young woman looked at me, and she said, 'I remember when I used to have that kind of confidence.' \"\n\nAs an educator and an advocate for girls and women, Kinsey said, she is focused on the gap between what we know girls need to thrive and be healthy and how we're teaching them every day, whether it's in the classroom or in the home.\n\n\"I think that better understanding that gap holds many of the keys to closing yet another gap, the success gap between how girls are faring in school -- where we know they're crushing it, and they're outperforming boys, and they're achieving at levels we've never seen before -- and how they're faring in life after school,\" Kinsey said. \"They're coming up against not only a structural glass ceiling but also a psychological glass ceiling that thwarts their self-actualization.\"\n\nKinsey was familiar with Simmons' books and incorporated her research into her work in higher education. When she moved to The Hewitt School, she wanted to bring Simmons' teachings and experience to students, faculty and parents in the community. In 2016, Simmons was named the inaugural Girls' Research Scholar in Residence at Hewitt.\n\nSimmons' work at Hewitt involves helping the girls and young women build their skills in the broad category of emotional intelligence, Kinsey said, with a focus on healthy risk-taking, conflict resolution, self-advocacy, managing friendships, and the giving and receiving of feedback.\n\nShe may be sprawled on the floor with an entire grade of middle-schoolers, tracing their bodies for an exercise on the difference between feelings you sometimes keep inside, such as jealousy, and feelings you express, such as anger. She might be sitting crisscross apple sauce with elementary school girls, talking about the difference between a real apology and a not-so-real apology.\n\nOr she may be standing on a chair and reciting a poem demonstrating how the pressure to be perfect really undermines the ability to give and receive authentic feedback.\n\n\"What I'm trying to do is fill in the blanks in terms of some of the skills that they don't have,\" Simmons said. \"So, sure, they're really good at doing their worksheets and the homework and sitting quietly in class discussions and taking exams, but when something goes off the rails, then we're working with them on, how do you cope? We're filling in the blanks, and I contend that if you fill in the blanks ... then we're going to see a better balance between all of this ... on-paper success and what's happening inside.\n\n\"But right now, things are out of whack. We got overdeveloped on paper and very underdeveloped in life and in terms of resilience (and) adaptability.\"\n\nIt is that fear of failure that can really be crippling for girls and young women today, which is why Simmons, who is also a leadership development specialist at Smith College, regularly concludes her orientation programs on college campuses with a graduation ceremony. The young women who attend will each receive a \"Certificate of Failure.\"\n\nThe mock diploma reads, \"Having honorably fulfilled all the requirements imposed by the overload of high school, you are hereby certified to screw up, bomb or otherwise fail\" during college \"and still be a totally worthy, utterly excellent human,\" Simmons writes in her book.\n\nThe girls laugh, she writes, but then they take those certificates back to their dorm rooms. \"Every girls needs a Certificate of Failure,\" she writes.\n\nHelping parents combat 'not-enoughness'\n\nAt Hewitt, Simmons also works with the teachers, helping them see the importance of trying to teach soft skills such as resilience and adaptability just like they are teaching anything else.\n\nInstead of giving feedback on written work, a teacher might do a one-on-one consultation with the student in which they focus on her goals and what she hopes to achieve in her next writing sample.\n\nIn math, teachers don't typically give girls grades on quizzes; they give written feedback so the girls can learn from their mistakes.\n\n\"You see how that's just completely transformative to girls and relationships, to their own achievement,\" Kinsey said. \"It's not about grades. It's about growth. It's about feedback. It's about failure. It's about honoring mistakes as a necessary part of the learning process.\"\n\nAs part of her work at Hewitt, Simmons also meets regularly with parents and tries to help them \"combat the sense of shame and 'not-enoughness' that so many parents have.\"\n\n\"This is an era in which parents are probably the least confident they're ever been in themselves,\" Simmons said. \"If we want our kids to feel like they are enough, the parents have to feel like they are enough.\"\n\nDuring coffee talks, she tries to help parents feel comfortable enough to share what they are most afraid of, such as concerns that their daughter doesn't have a ton of friends or isn't getting the best grades.\n\n\"We had a couple of faculty members who aren't parents who were sitting there going, 'Oh, my God. I had no idea that parents were that scared about their kids, and all I see is 'my daughter didn't get a good grade on the test,' and that anger is actually fear,'\" Kinsey said. \"That anger is fear, and what Rachel is doing in such a beautiful way is saying ''if you don't get in touch with that, you're not really modeling for girls what they need.' \"\n\nMuffy Flouret, who has a daughter in the seventh grade at Hewitt, said Simmons is helping students and parents understand what it means to fail and how to bounce back.\n\n\"She's on the edge of the research of how do we raise girls in the community, and it's invaluable, because parents who might not think twice about saying, 'Well, you didn't get the A. I'm not so happy about that,' might now think twice about that reaction,\" Flouret said.\n\nShe also said Simmons is helping the community understand the perils of trying to be the best at everything.\n\n\"To create this sort of pressure that you have to be the top of the soccer team and you have to be top of the debate team, it's not sustainable, and it's not realistic,\" she said. \"Where does that leave you as an adult?

They are 4\u00bd years apart, and somewhere in that gap -- thanks to the suggestions of the progressive, mindful parenting books we regularly consume -- we did away with the popular refuge of nearly all parents (probably since the dawn of time): the \"timeout.\" As some Neanderthal dad probably yelled, \"Go to your part of the cave until you've calmed down!\"\n\nThe arguments for the timeout boil down to: 1. It's better than spanking. (True.) 2. Parents want a little time away from a child's aggravating behavior. (No doubt.)\n\nTimeouts have been popular for decades and are still recommended by some parenting experts. But it's time to add the timeout to the parental dust bin of history, along with yelling, hitting and missing school in order to help run the farm.\n\nHere is the fundamental failure of the timeout: It's tantamount to abandoning your kid when they need you most. If they're acting up, it may be to get your attention. If they are upset or angry, they want you to connect with them (even if they push you away). Your calm, listening presence or a long hug -- not isolation -- is what they need to reconnect to their rational brain.\n\nGo Ask Your Dad is parenting advice with a philosophical bent as one dad explores what we want out of life, for ourselves and our children, through useful paradigms and best practices. It considers old problems in new ways, and new problems that previous generations didn't face.\n\nThese moments just after upsetting behavior and anger -- yours and theirs -- can move a parent-child relationship closer or farther apart.\n\nNeed some solid social science to convince you? The National Institute of Mental Health conducted a study in 1982 (the timeout method hasn't changed since then) that found kids who had timeouts -- or \"love withdrawal,\" as the study's authors also called the method -- were more misbehaved , even when moms in the study talked to their kids after their timeout reflection.\n\nPremier parenting academic Alfie Kohn has written extensively about the negative effects on a child's moral and psychological development due to timeouts and other love-withdrawal techniques. He cites child psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, who concluded that timeouts can cause \"deep feelings of anxiety.\"\n\nAnd if you're telling yourself a timeout is not a punishment but rather a much-needed break for reflection and self-calming, let me ask you: Does your child think it's a punishment? If so, then it is.\n\nDescribing timeouts in their book \"How to Talk so Kids Can Learn,\" Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish write, \"As an adult you can imagine how resentful and humiliated you would feel if someone forced you into isolation for something you said or did.\"\n\nWhat's the alternative?\n\nI bet most parents who use the timeout -- which seems to work in the short run (perhaps because it triggers a child's fear of abandonment , according to developmental psychologist Aletha Solter) -- do so because it's expedient. If we had an alternative that worked more effectively and just as swiftly, we'd gladly use it.\n\nThe answer is \"time-ins.\" That sounds too cute to be real advice, but maybe it's just catchy enough that you will remember it when you're driven to the point of anger and not thinking straight yourself. Fight the urge to push your troubled kid away and work to embrace them instead.\n\nWhen you remove the option of distance and solitude, you have no choice but to engage. That step, by the way, is often all it takes to stop the behavior. But you can also help them calm themselves; a few deep breaths is remarkably effective.\n\nAnd then you both can find a solution together as a team instead of in opposition. Listen fully and patiently to their version of the story. And talk about mitigating factors. Are they hungry, angry, lonely, tired, stressed or sick (a list that forms the handy acronym HALTSS)?\n\nSometimes there are no solutions. We all just need to be heard sometimes. After you understand where they're coming from, try reflecting their feelings back to them. \"You feel sad that the playdate has to end.\" \"That's so frustrating when a plan doesn't work out like we hoped.\"\n\nTime-ins demonstrate to them you care, even when times get tough. It conveys the message that their \"bad\" emotions (which are really just difficult, yet perfectly natural, ones) are as acceptable as their pleasant, happy emotions. Time-ins also teach kids to pay closer attention to their feelings and needs, and get better at finding solutions to their problems. These moments -- when, reflexively, a timeout seems the easiest route -- are great parenting opportunities to connect (aka love) and teach life skills.\n\nSometimes, especially with older kids, they may genuinely want you to go away. But stay close. Maybe refrain from talking. If you leave the room, check in after a bit.\n\nMy wife and I give ourselves timeouts on occasion when we need a break. But sending yourself away is not the same as abandoning them, especially if you explain your emotional state before you excuse yourself. You are modeling the fact that everyone needs to give themselves recovery breaks (whether it's 30 seconds or 30 minutes). Your kids may use it as a model for themselves.\n\nExperiment: Give up timeouts for a month\n\nI'm guessing you won't be convinced that time-ins are more effective than timeouts unless you give it a try. See what happens when you issue no timeouts for a month. It may be a mess at first, but I'm convinced you'll see some significant results within a month.\n\nJoin the conversation on CNN Parenting's Facebook page See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Parenting on Facebook.\n\nOur home experiment had similar results as the National Institute of Mental Health study. If timeouts were effective, our younger child (who never got one) would be a terror. And our older one would have acted out more when we ceased to deploy them. But neither happened. In fact, we doubled down and largely did away with punishments altogether. The net result has been less confrontation, more cohesion, more solutions.\n\nOur first daughter is 10 years old and has recently started the tween-age rite of passage of occasionally storming off to her room. Sometimes, she adds the slammed door as a kinetic exclamation mark. It's a timeout of a different of color -- one she imposes on herself. But my wife or I will check in after a few minutes and see whether she wants to talk. Sometimes, I need to apologize if I'm the one who her upset her. But if she still wants to be by herself, we respect that. She knows we're nearby, always ready for when she needs a time-in.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/16/health/time-out-parenting-go-ask-your-dad/index.html", "published": "2018-02-16T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How to talk to kids about tragic events", "text": "Kelly Wallace is CNN's digital correspondent and editor-at-large covering family, career and life. Read her other columns, and follow her reports at CNN Parents and on Twitter.\n\n(CNN) After horrific events like shootings or attacks by terrorists, parents are faced with this dilemma: What do I tell my kids? How can I talk to them about something so senseless and indiscriminate? About something that we can't make sense of ourselves?\n\n\"It's important to explain to children the rarity of these events,\" said Dr. Gail Saltz, who has been in private practice as a psychiatrist for more than 20 years and serves as a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the New York Presbyterian Hospital/Weill-Cornell School of Medicine.\n\nSaltz, whose latest book is \"The Power of Different: The Link Between Disorder and Genius,\" said parents can comfort their children by telling them these attacks may seem more frequent due to the global nature of news and the repetition of images surrounding the events on social media.\n\nParents should also realize that increased anxiety after an event like this is normal, experts say, even if the attack happened in another country, because social media makes the world feel very small.\n\n\"Over time, however, in allowing questions and shared thoughts along with reassurances about efforts by your family and security to increase safety while living your lives, anxiety should diminish,\" said Saltz.\n\nParents should keep an eye out for \"dramatic changes\" in behavior such as the way their kids interact with family and friends, or if they experience a sudden drop in grades, said Kelly Ward Becker, chief executive officer of Family Lives on Foundation, which supports the emotional well-being of grieving children.\n\n\"It's important to keep the channels of communication open to keep a pulse on your child's reactions and feelings,\" she said. \"Acknowledge their emotions and legitimize whatever feelings they are experiencing, which may range from sadness, anger or apparent indifference.\"\n\n\"While a wish to reassure might be our first instinct, what is needed is primarily to listen,\" said Gold. \"More than finding the 'right' thing to say is to use our own comforting presence.\"\n\nAfter an attack, it's more important than ever for parents \"to remain in check in relation to their anxiety,\" said Ferrara, who has been in private practice for more than a decade.\n\n\"If adults show an excessive level of anxiety and vulnerability, that will certainly create higher anxiety in children,\" she said.\n\nFerrara, Gold, Saltz and other parenting experts offer a range of tips on how to reduce anxiety in children -- and stress that the age of children and their temperament really determines what -- and how much -- to share.\n\nLimiting media exposure is key\n\nIf possible, children younger than 5 do not need to be told about what happened or exposed to any of the media coverage, said Ferrara. \"Keeping to routine is the best way to reassure children about the safety of their immediate world,\" she said.\n\nJUST WATCHED The mental cost of trauma Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The mental cost of trauma 01:19\n\nChildren ages 6 to 11 need just basic facts and minimal exposure to media coverage, she said, adding that there are definite lessons from what children saw in the media following the September 11, 2001, attacks. She points to studies that found that children who had repeated and prolonged exposure to media images had more difficulty with anxiety than kids with less exposure.\n\nIn a statement after the 2015 Paris attacks, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged parents to be careful with images that children see. \"As pediatricians, we know that violence can have lasting effects on children even if they are only learning about it through the media,\" the statement said. The organization offered more resources for parents on how to talk to children about mass tragedies.\n\n\"A child will store the event in memory based on the narrative you assign the event,\" Ferrara said. \"For this age range, stick to basic facts and turn off the TV.\"\n\nSaltz agrees, and said parents of young children should \"stick to basic broad-stroke facts\" and avoid any \"nitty gritty details that are disturbing.\"\n\nParents should then communicate to their children an openness and willingness to talk, answering their questions and listening to their feelings, she said.\n\n\"Make it clear you understand their feelings. In other words, don't blow them off or avoid their feelings. This can be hard when they're (being) upset makes you more upset,\" said Saltz, author of \"The Anatomy of a Secret Life.\" \"But expressing their feelings will help them to cope. Then be reassuring about all of the security at work protecting us, and how rare an event this really is.\"\n\nHow to reassure your child\n\nReassurance is one of the most important things parents can provide children during a time of tragedy, when they fear it could happen to them, said Dr. Glenn Saxe, chairman of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU's Langone Medical Center , in a previous interview.\n\n\"The first kind of thought and feeling is, 'Am I safe? Are people close to me safe? Will something happen? Will people I depend on protect me?' \" said Saxe, who is also director of the NYU Child Study Center.\n\n\"You want to be assuring to your child, you want to communicate that you're ... doing everything you can do to keep them safe,\" Saxe said. \"You also want to not give false assurances, too. And this is also depending on the age of the child. You have to be real about it as well.\"\n\nIt helps, too, for parents to acknowledge their own fears about how to keep children safe, even amid unpredictable violence, said Gold, who is also author of \"The Silenced Child: From Labels, Medications, and Quick-Fix Solutions to Listening, Growth and Lifelong Resilience.\" It might seem counterintuitive, but acknowledging uncertainty can help parents connect with their children, and lead to a stronger sense of safety and security.\n\nShe points to how people have taken to the streets after recent attacks expressing that they will not be afraid. \"When our children can sense that courage in us, they too will not be afraid. When we can manage our own anxieties, we are in a better position to listen to the responses of our children, which may differ according to their unique individual qualities.\"\n\nDr. Joe Taravella, supervisor of pediatric psychology at NYU Langone Medical Center's Rusk Rehabilitation, said parents should not be afraid to show their own emotions about tragic events. Children pick up on the \"emotional temperature that's in the home,\" even if we think we're hiding how we truly feel, he said.\n\n\"We are our children's role models, so we should be leading by example at all times and when we're sad,\" said Taravella. \"We talk about our sadness so we can talk about us being fearful and sad that this happened, but then, I always try and end on the positive to help them cope or deal with it, that we are a family and that we support each other as a family.\"\n\nParents should also be mindful of any changes in their children's behavior after learning about a tragedy, Taravella said.\n\n\"I would try and put their behaviors into words like saying, 'I see that you've been more cranky lately or more upset, I'm wondering if something's going on, if you feel upset about something,' \" he said, which might help them communicate what they are feeling.\n\nHelping teens open up\n\nFor teens, who will most likely have heard about violent events or attacks through social media or news coverage, it is best to start by asking what they know, Ferrara said. Parents should also not assume their children are processing the events or trauma surrounding the events the same way they are, she added.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Initially, it is possible they may not have much to say,\" she said, but they might revisit the topic when something connects to them personally.\n\n\"Events like this sometimes defy language, and a teen may struggle to discuss. However, remain open for these emerging adults. They need to know that they matter and that the world's complexity is in dire need of their taking the time to think about and understand what it means to be global citizens,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a shared responsibility that none of us, parent or young adult child, is able to avoid.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2015/11/16/health/talking-to-kids-tragic-events-advice-parents/index.html", "published": "2015-11-16T00:00:00"}, {"title": "The meaning(s) of (your) life", "text": "This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness.

Don't miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here .\n\n(CNN) Every January for the past 20 years, I have taken a few moments to ponder the answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\"\n\nIt's one of those enormous questions that's so important -- philosophically and practically in terms of how we live our lives -- and yet we never stop to really think about the answer. Given that you might be able to formulate your response in less than a minute, the wisdom-to-effort ratio for this philosophical exercise could not be more advantageous.\n\nThis simple exercise might even help you live longer. According to two separate studies published in 2014 -- one among 9,000 participants over age 65 and another among 6,000 people between 20 and 75 -- those who could articulate the meaning and purpose of their lives died later than those who saw their lives as aimless. It didn't seem to matter what meaning participants ascribed to their life, whether it was personal (like happiness), creative (like making art) or altruistic (like making the world a better place). It was having an answer to the question that mattered.\n\nThe connection to longevity could be causal (having purpose may help one cope with daily stress , as other research has shown), but it could also be that those who think about life's meaning are more likely to do other activities that promote good health.\n\nThe reason I ask this question year after year is because my answer changes over time, which I find interesting and insightful. There is no objectively correct answer, I believe, only answers that are right for you at any given time.\n\nGreat thinkers (and celebrities) have given the question thought, so you can look to the words attributed to them for inspiration. Aristotle, the Greek philosopher who lived 2,500 years ago, is believed to have written that the essence of life is \"to serve others and to do good,\" and the Roman philosopher Cicero, born 280 years later, came to the same conclusion. As did Russian author Leo Tolstoy, who wrote, \"The sole meaning of life is to serve humanity.\" And His Holiness the Dalai Lama added, \"if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them.\"\n\nScottish rugby legend Nelson Henderson put the same notion poetically when he said, \"The true meaning of life is to plant trees, under whose shade you do not expect to sit.\" And actress Whoopi Goldberg's meaning-of-life metaphor was to \"throw little torches out to lead people through the dark.\"\n\n\"Love\" was the conclusion of Trappist monk and writer Thomas Merton, and \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" actress Julie Benz. Alternatively, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger concluded, \"The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.\"\n\nMy favorite answer, though, is the Zen-like circular reasoning attributed to writer Robert Byrne, who put it, \"The purpose of life is a life of purpose.\"\n\nSome have concluded that life's meaning is subjective. \"There is not one big cosmic meaning for all,\" Ana\u00efs Nin wrote in her diary. \"There is only the meaning we each give to our life, an individual meaning, an individual plot, like an individual novel, a book for each person.\"\n\nI agree, which is why I recommend formulating your own answer. \"Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life. It is not something discovered: It is something molded,\" wrote Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, well-known for his book \"The Little Prince.\"\n\nTaking a few moments to record your answer to the question \"what is the meaning of life?\" is the kind of simple exercise that effectively adds meaning to your life.\n\nAnd then I suggest answering it every year. Looking back at how your thinking has evolved and been influenced by experience tells you something more about yourself. Cumulatively, it gets you closer to a deeper self-understanding.\n\nIn 1997, my answer was \"the discovery, pursuit and attainment of one's bliss,\" inspired by myth expert Joseph Campbell. A year later, is was to make \"the world a better place.\" In 2002, the year I got engaged, it was simply \"Love.\" And the year we conceived our oldest daughter, it was the less-romantic \"continuation of one's DNA to the next generation.\" But most years, my answer is some combination of love, legacy, happiness, experience and helping others.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nAs a practical matter, if you want to do the annual \"Meaning\" exercise, I suggest not looking at past answers before answering anew, to avoid biasing your answer. I write them down on the same now-yellowing piece of loose-leaf paper, and keep it someplace safe.\n\nThe last use of this experiment is to try to turn your answer into action. If you conclude, as Tolstoy and Aristotle did, that the meaning of life to help others, that should help motivate you to do more of it. If \"love,\" is the answer, then love more. If it's \"find your bliss,\" then get searching for it.\n\nThis is not a theoretical exercise. Whatever small step you make toward finding the meaning of life is a step toward a more meaningful, and longer, life.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/31/health/meaning-of-life-wisdom-project/index.html", "published": "2018-01-31T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Start a new (good) habit, kill an old (bad) one", "text": "This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness.

As a species, we are impressively committed to self-improvement, and most of us believe that habits are an effective means to that end.\n\nHabits -- actions performed with little conscious thought and often unwittingly triggered by external cues -- are powerful influences on behavior and can be our greatest allies for positive change. But because they are so difficult to break, habits are also frequent saboteurs of personal progress.\n\n\"Habit is a good servant but a bad master\" is how author Gretchen Rubin summed it up in her book \"Better Than Before: Mastering the Habit of Our Everyday Lives.\" Hers was one of three recent books I read back-to-back on the subject of habit formation; the others were Charles Duhigg's \"The Power of Habit\" and Jeremy Dean's \"Making Habits, Breaking Habits.\" Together, they helped me understand more deeply the importance of habit control, how to choose a habit to begin or end, and the mechanics of sticking with it.\n\nThe first thing to know, each book explained, is that a lot of our daily actions are so rote, they are automatic. \"All our life ... is but a mass of habits,\" philosopher and psychologist William James wrote, though a 2006 study put the amount of habitual daily action at 40% . Still, that's a lot of mindless behavior.\n\nIt's helpful that we don't need to think about how or when to drink coffee, brush our teeth or drive to work. If we did, we'd waste so much time rethinking or learning those tasks, we'd get little else done.\n\nThe whole trick is to get habits to work for you, not against you. Self-control is a limited resource, Dean explains, so a good habit means not having to exert effort every time you need to do the right thing.\n\nRoom to grow\n\nThe first thing to identify for yourself is the habit you want to work on, whether it's starting a new (good) one or ending an old (bad) one. That's a minor distinction, by the way. Eating healthier is eating less junk. Exercising more is being less sedentary. One is often the inverse of another.\n\nThis step requires some honest self-evaluation. What is not working in your life? What personality flaws are holding you back? Where is there room to do better?\n\nWe know what many of the most common areas of improvement are, at least when it comes to making resolutions. People want to lose weight, eat better, be more mindful, spend money more wisely, sleep better and improve relationships. By eliminating bad habits and starting new ones, you can succeed in most of these areas.\n\nOne helpful checklist frequently used for goal-setting is the acronym SMART, created by economic theorist Peter Drucker. Effective resolutions, research has shown, are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound.\n\nBefore finishing the first book (Dean's, which is the most prescriptive and research- and science-based), I decided on two habits to work on myself. The first was to be more present and mindful with my kids. The second was to stop seeking out and consuming free, non-nutritious food at work. One was a good habit to start, the other a bad habit to quit.\n\nRubin, who approaches the topic personally and looks for specific techniques that work for her, recommends starting a habit at the same time as a big turning point such as pregnancy, marriage, a medical diagnosis, a family death, an anniversary, a long trip or a new year.\n\nRepeal and replace your behavior\n\nThe consensus among these books is that the most effective way to adopt a habit is to replace a bad one with a better one. Dean's metaphor is to think of habits as well-worn rivers of action that flow out of the predictable path of your routine. Often, the most effective way to stop it flowing in harmful directions is not by damming it but by diverting it. For example, many people stop smoking by chewing gum.\n\nThe point is that bad habits die hard, and as with riding a bike, your brain never stops learning how to do them.\n\nSo it's easier to think about any habit formation, even new \"good\" ones, in terms of replacing unwanted behavior. That made sense for my snacking at work. I started buying healthy yet still delicious snacks to keep there: yogurt instead of morning doughnuts, dried papaya instead of chocolate, sweetened rice cakes instead of stale leftover doughnuts. A supply of healthy snack options kept me on a new course of action that largely followed the old eating habit pattern.\n\nTo be more mindful with my kids, I needed to avoid the opposite behaviors, such as checking my work phone or planning activities while with them so I could focus on their needs and thoughts.\n\nDuhigg explains that habit \"reversal therapy\" is a legitimate technique used for things like tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as predilections such as gambling, smoking and bed-wetting.\n\nIt's important to make a distinction between a bad habit and addiction, however, even if the behaviors seem to overlap. Addiction requires greater intervention than habit hacking.\n\nDean describes the hallmarks of addiction as not being in control and not being aware of time/energy spent on the behavior. People with addictions are preoccupied with soothing a craving and needing more and more to get the same effect, as well as suffering withdrawal without it. Unlike bad habits, addictions eat away at important activities such as relationships and work. They tend to be an escape from normal life and are often hidden from others.\n\nThe wonderful thing about triggers\n\nWe like to think we have free will in every situation, but many of our actions are predictably triggered by external situations. And if those events are part of your daily or weekly routine, our Pavlovian tendencies become ingrained. Pajamas are on: Time to floss and brush. Cup of coffee in hand: Time to dunk a doughnut. Beer finished: Let's have a cigarette. But triggers can also be feelings, such as stress or boredom.\n\nBeing aware of your triggers is the first step in learning how to keep them from sabotaging you and make them work for you instead. Is there a certain time of day or task when you crave a treat? What do you always do when you feel stress (go for a run or go for a drink)? What is your bedtime ritual to let your brain know it's time to sleep?\n\nYou can help create conditions to avoid triggers, but not fully. If the trigger is deeply ingrained, maybe going back years, it will sabotage you when your guard is down. For these situations, you need contingencies. Dean calls them \"If ... then ...\" plans. When trigger X happens, I won't do bad habit Y, as I usually do, but I will replace it with much healthier Z action.\n\nMy favorite example of effective trigger planning is Starbucks, a company that puts a higher premium on customer service than on the (habit-fueled) products it sells. Duhigg, who prefers Malcom Gladwell-esque case studies for his book, explains that the chain's baristas are well trained on what to do when something goes wrong, such as a messed-up order that angers a customer. Rather than improvise or consider options in those moments, they practice rapid responses -- such as apologizing and offering a replacement drink for free -- until it's second nature.\n\nYou likewise need to have a plan for when a strong, perhaps rare, trigger threatens your winning habit streak. Ordinarily, I can avoid eating cupcakes at work, but what's my plan when I've skipped lunch, it's late afternoon, I have some onerous task that would be made more enjoyable with a treat, and the cupcake is filled with peanut butter?\n\n66 is the magic number\n\nAccording to one study cited by Dean and Rubin, it takes 66 days of doing something to convert it to a habit. However, that number varies depending on the person and activity. For example, it took those participating in the study less than 20 days to habitualize drinking a glass of water every day, 60 days for eating fruit with lunch and more then 84 days to make 50 sit-ups a daily habit. Some habits could take a year to form. But 66 days is a good target.\n\nI avoided work snacking and improved my capacity for parental mindfulness for 66 days straight. Or rather, I diligently monitored these habits over 66 days, because another pillar of successful habit formation is tracking. Even something as subjective as \"be more present with my kids\" can be numerically self-scored every evening.\n\nAnd another pro tip of habit-making (or replacing) is accountability. Tell other people. Share on social media (unless social media is the habit you're changing). Ask your friends and family to support the effort. Getting others involved, or even just aware, makes it harder for you to give it up. And others' support can be inspiring and helpful.\n\nTreat yo'self: rewards\n\nUnlike tracking and accountability, incentives are a debatable strategy. Duhigg believes that they are central to the exercise, because habits are reward-based. Rubin concludes that external rewards take you away from internalizing the right motivation behind your new habit.\n\nFor me, rewards have been pivotal. Five years ago, I took off 25 pounds and have kept it off by establishing an elaborate reward system\n\nIf you do treat yourself for keeping a habit, make sure it's not self-defeating. You may not want to reward, say, avoiding doughnuts by indulging in a half-gallon of ice cream.\n\nAnd that's one to grow on\n\nAt the end of 66 days, I stopped tracking my new habits and found that they had largely stuck. When I came home from work, seeing the faces of my daughters was the trigger to remind me to give them my undivided focus. I rarely (instead of automatically) checked my phone for work updates, and I put off my personal agenda items until after bedtime. And I replaced workplace snacking with my private stash of more nutritious snacks: same trigger, but alternate behavior at much fewer calories.\n\nThe real test though, is time. More than six months have passed since my 66 days of daily tracking, and I'm still doing a solid job on mindful parenting. I have occasionally slipped on the work snacking, though. I wouldn't say I've failed at it, because I'm building up a new long-term habit muscle for healthy snacking, and I ate a lot less junk food than I would have without trying.\n\nRubin would call it \"stumbling,\" and we should accept that it happens in the habit game. Stumbling is not a reason to quit trying.\n\nSubscribe to this column Don't miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here.\n\nYou may want to read one of the habit books, too. The three overlap and support each other, but my personal preference was for Rubin's, largely because I feel a kinship with her love of life-hacking, introspection and applied psychology.\n\nShe's the author of the bestselling \"The Happiness Project\" and wrote this new book, she explained, after concluding that habits were the best means to actually achieve happiness.\n\nBut I'll give the last word to the wise Ben Franklin, whose advice would make all these books unnecessary. \" 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits than to break them,\" he wrote.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/05/health/habits-wisdom-project/index.html", "published": "2018-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Why did you become a parent?

And some have always known the answer, maybe since they were kids themselves.\n\nBut for many parents and would-be parents, the question may seem odd or elementary -- which makes it a great question to tackle.\n\nOne answer is that we, as a species, harbor an evolutionary drive to propagate. Our small part -- at its most basic, perhaps unconscious and even (by design) pleasurable level -- is to carry on our DNA to the next generation. If enough of us do that (and we avoid destroying the planet), human beings will thrive.\n\nAnother answer is simply social and cultural norms. The majority of the people you know, and most of those you don't, are doing it. This is why people who don't have kids often have an answer to \"Why?\" at the ready: because everyone asks them. Rarely, though, are parents asked what motivated them to have kids. There's little need to explain behavior that is typical and expected.\n\nBut even with evolutionary hardwiring and societal peer pressure as part of the equation, that usually doesn't fully explain the unique, individual drives that lead people to want to make other people.\n\nWhatever your reason, it says something important about you and about the kind of parent you are or hope to be. I think it's worth exploring.\n\nYou are the parenting expert you've been looking for\n\nWhy did you decide to have children? Why do you want one, or a second or third? What is it about your personal desires, history, influences and beliefs that led to such a major life decision? Why spend so much time and money, and take on all that additional stress, anxiety and responsibility?\n\nKnowing why you got into this game can give you the insight needed to play it to the best of your ability. You are your own best guide to navigating the million and one parenting questions, conundrums and choices you will face from here on out.\n\nHistorically, people have had children out of economic necessity, to work the farm, for example. Conversely, children can be symbols of prosperity. They can be a reflection of yourself or a vessel for your own wishes and goals. Or parenting can be a noble act of sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nPete Seeger is credited with this sweet answer: \"We do it for the high wages ... kisses.\"\n\nWhen I asked friends and family this question, it was interesting to see how some knew their answers right away while others stared off in the distance with a puzzled look on their faces, as if they'd never pondered it before.\n\nHere's a taste:\n\nRe-create my own childhood joys\n\nGrow and share familial love\n\nMake myself a better person\n\nStart my own family after being on my own for a long time\n\nAdd to a greater sense of life's purpose\n\nFit in and meet society's expectations\n\nBecause kids are fun to hang out with and talk to\n\nHelp make the world a better place\n\nBe a better parent than I had\n\nA spiritual call to action\n\nRepay what I owe my parents\n\nGive in to a biological urge\n\nCultivate a strong relationship with my kids so they remain a part of my life after they move out\n\nMy wife had her answer at the ready: \"I wanted to feel the intense love a parent has for a child.\" It's a desire she's had since she was a young girl.\n\nAs I began to tell her my reason, I saw a nervous look on her face.\n\n\"I feel like we should have had this conversation before we had kids,\" she said, cutting me off. \"What if I don't think your answer is a good one?\"\n\n\"Too late,\" I said.\n\nMy reasoning lies in the high premium I put on experience: travel. Film. Reading. Writing. Storytelling. Humor. Food and drink (more drink than food). Spirituality. Nature.\n\nBeing a parent is a unique experience. I am aware of the missed adventures and career options I might have pursued were it not for my two daughters. But still, being their father comes out far ahead.\n\nI also hubristically thought I'd be very good at parenting. There's a part of me that wanted to improve upon my own upbringing. Since I was a kid, I'd been convinced I would be an amazing father.\n\nThat was, of course, before I became one. Parenting, it turns out, is humbling in the way it exposes your insecurities and personality flaws. I'm getting better, and I try to live up to that potential, but I routinely fall short -- which every parent can relate to.\n\nPut your answer to good use\n\n\"Mindful parenting\" is one of the most enlightened trends in the history of parenting techniques. It's about being present with your children but also better understanding your motivations and feelings while parenting. Getting in touch with your motivation for becoming a parent gives you a perspective too often lacking at difficult parenting moments.\n\nMy answer, about wanting these unique and varied parenting experiences, has helped me embrace a wider spectrum of them. It's easy to revel in a bear hug or a shared laugh, but I'm extending that love of experience for more challenging moments, such getting screamed at in the middle of a bath time. Staying present and connected to whatever is going on when I'm with my daughters gives them more of the attention they need from me and makes meaningful moments more frequent and poignant.\n\nYour own answer to the question is something of a parental compass needle too, pointing the way when you are unsure how to parent in a given situation.\n\nGet back to the roots of your parenting motivation. It could impact how you respond to frustrating moments, how you spend your weekends, what behavior you model and how you talk to your children about life.\n\nNew CNN Parenting column: Go Ask Your Dad\n\nThis column, The Wisdom Project , is getting a spinoff series called Go Ask Your Dad, about parenting wisdom.

Where are you on the curve?\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics warns that overuse of digital media and screens can put children and teens at risk of obesity, sleep problems, cyberbullying and negative performance at school. There are also safety concerns: The academy encourages parents to talk to their children about online safety and safeguarding privacy, ask them to refrain from risky online behavior like sexting and be wary of online solicitations.\n\nJust how much time are children spending buried in screens?\n\nA report released this year by Common Sense Media said children up to age 8 spend an average of 2 hours and 19 minutes every day on screen media. The lion's share of that time is occupied by TV and video viewing alone; it takes up 72% of all screen time.\n\nThat's an increase from 2011, when the average daily screen media time for the same age group was 1 hour 55 minutes. Time spent on most devices, including TV, computers, video games and DVDs, has dropped since 2011, but time spent on mobile phones has increased significantly. (The recent results were obtained through a survey of 1,454 parents of children age 8 or under conducted in January and February.)\n\nRead More\n\nFor 8- to 12-year-olds, the average time spent using screen media every day was 4 hours and 36 minutes, according to a 2015 Common Sense Media report . Tweens spent an average of 4\u00bd hours per day with screen media and 6 hours with all media, including reading and listening to music. The report said the top activity among tweens was watching TV: Nearly 62% of those surveyed said they watch TV every day. But according to the 2015 report, there are differences in how tweens of different genders use their screen time. Boys spend more time playing console video games, while girls spend more time on music and social media. Mobile devices accounted for 41% of all screen time among tweens. Kids under 9 spend more than 2 hours a day on screens, report shows The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen media use for children younger than 18 months to video chatting. For older children, it advises that parents choose high-quality content and watch it with their children to help them understand what they're seeing. Moreover, the academy says that screen media use should not interfere with children's sleep and exercise routines. The organization urges parents to ensure that their children have media-free times with the family and designate areas of the home as media-free zones.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/15/health/screen-time-averages-parenting/index.html", "published": "2017-11-15T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Would you let your child play football?", "text": "Story highlights Tackle football remains a popular sport for children, despite parents' safety concerns\n\n982,000 children ages 6 to 12 played tackle football in the US in 2016, survey said\n\nThe Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face.

Where are you on the curve?\n\nThat's a 1.8% dip in participation since 2011 -- between 2012 and 2014, youth participation was shrinking by the tens of thousands each year -- but numbers have started to grow, including a 1.7% increase from 2015 to 2016.\n\nRead More\n\nMillions more kids ages 6 to 12 play basketball, baseball and outdoor soccer, according to the association. But some sports have seen larger drops in participation, it said, including track and field, which decreased by 24.7% since 2011, outdoor soccer by 19%, baseball by 8.9% and basketball by 4%. While NFL concussions are down, parents continue to debate football safety The decrease in football participation may have been due to concerns of player concussions, noted Jon Butler, executive director of Pop Warner Football, a youth football and cheerleading organization. Other factors might include children specializing in individual sports or fewer children playing organized youth sports overall, he said. Pop Warner currently has 88,850 kids ages 6 to 12 enrolled in football and has maintained a total football enrollment of more than 225,000 participants in the past five years, according to the organization. The stability of football participation rates over recent years shows that \"there is a strong foundation of kids who love to play football with their parents' support,\" said Steve Alic, a spokesman for USA Football. Keeping young players safe on the football field In a 2015 policy statement , the American Academy of Pediatrics' Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness noted that most youth football injuries are minor, but \"incidences of severe injuries, catastrophic injuries, and concussion, however, are higher in football than most other team sports and appear to increase with age.\" In its recommendations, the pediatricians' organization said that officials and coaches must enforce rules of the game to ensure safety and that a \"culture of tolerance for head first, illegal hits ... has to change.\" It suggests that participants weigh potential health risks against the recreation benefits of proper tackling. Delaying the introduction of tackling would probably decrease risk or injury, the statement said, and teams should try to have athletic trainers on the sidelines during games and practices.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/02/health/youth-football-parent-curve/index.html", "published": "2017-11-02T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How many kids still believe in Santa?", "text": "The Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face.

Those numbers were published in a small study in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry in 1978.\n\nBut researchers say those percentages of young children who believe in jolly old Saint Nick seem to have remained steady over the years.\n\nThe Parent Curve offers a look at the norms and numbers around tough decisions parents face. Where are you on the curve?\n\nResearch in the Journal of Cognition and Development in 2011 shows that 83% of 5-year-olds think that Santa Claus is real, the study's lead author, Jacqueline Woolley, wrote in The Conversation last year.\n\n\"We have found in more recent studies that that number of 85% sounds about right,\" said Thalia Goldstein, assistant professor of applied developmental psychology at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n\"Children's belief in Santa starts when they're between 3 and 4 years old. It's very strong when they're between about 4 and 8,\" she said. \"Then, at 8 years old is when we start to see the drop-off in belief, when children start to understand the reality of Santa Claus.\"\n\nNearly three-quarters of Americans say they typically received Christmas Eve visits from Santa as children, and one in five adults says they are the parent or guardian of a child in their home who believes in Santa, according to a Pew Research Center study published in 2013.\n\nOutside the United States, how many children believe in Papa Noel? The percentage appears to be similar in some European countries.\n\nOf 161 parents in the United Kingdom, 92.5% thought Father Christmas was real for their children up to the age of 8, according to a research paper presented at the annual meeting of the European Early Childhood Education Research Association in Finland in 1999.\n\nIt turns out that the more live Santa Clauses children are exposed to, the more likely they are to believe that he is the \"real\" Santa, according to a study published last year in the journal Cognitive Development\n\nGoldstein co-authored the small study with Woolley, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe study involved 77 children, 2 to 10 years old, who were interviewed after visiting a man dressed up as Santa Claus at a children's science museum in Norwalk, Connecticut. The interviews were conducted over the course of one week, before Christmas.\n\nThe interviews revealed that 39.2% of the children believed that the man they visited was the same Santa who came down their chimneys. An additional 38.8% didn't believe that he was the same person but thought he also lived at the North Pole and could communicate with the real Santa, Goldstein said.\n\nThen, 13.8% said that the man was not Santa but that he shared characteristics with the real Santa, and 1.3% had a somewhat \"adult belief,\" Goldstein said, in which they said that the man was not Santa and did not live at the North Pole but could communicate with the real Santa.\n\nA limitation of the study was that older children who do not believe in Santa were excluded from the sample of participants since they \"may have been reluctant to accompany their parents to this event,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"Age didn't predict whether or not they thought that live Santa was the real guy, and then we also found that what the parents were telling the children -- the amount of Santa activities and Santa promotion that the parents were engaging with -- also didn't affect whether or not the children believed that he was the real-life Santa,\" Goldstein said.\n\n\"The only thing that affected their belief was how many other Santa Clauses they had interacted with that year,\" she said.\n\nOn the other hand, age and cognitive development seem to predict when kids start to lose their belief in Santa, said Andrew Shtulman, a cognitive developmental psychologist and associate professor at Occidental College in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's not a coincidence that children stop believing in Santa during the early elementary school years, because that's a time when they are developing more sophisticated notions of what is possible and what is not,\" said Shtulman, who has led separate research on children's belief in Santa Claus\n\nJUST WATCHED Mila Kunis' daughter 'too logical' for Santa Replay More Videos ...

Those findings were published in the journal Sleep Medicine in 2010.\n\nThe parents were from China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. They completed the questionnaires between May and June 2006, September and December 2007 and April 2008.\n\nThe researchers found that the latest bedtimes were reported among parents in Hong Kong, who on average reported bedtimes about 10:17 p.m., whereas the earliest bedtimes were reported among parents in New Zealand: around 7:28 p.m., on average.\n\nThe study was sponsored by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson, and Mindell has served as a consultant for the company.\n\nBedtimes also appear to vary across European countries, said Sara Harkness, a professor and director of the Center for the Study of Culture, Health, and Human Development at the University of Connecticut.\n\nShe was not involved in the Sleep Medicine study but has conducted research on children's activities and bedtimes.\n\n\"We certainly did find in our research in Spain that early bedtimes were not common for young children. In fact, on one occasion, our Spanish colleague invited us to watch preschool children in a performance at a local festival starting about 11 p.m.,\" Harkness said.\n\n\"The most dramatic contrast we've seen to this pattern is in the Netherlands, where babies and young children are put to bed at around 6:30 or 7 and expected to sleep through the night in their own bed, often in their own room,\" she said.\n\nOn the other hand, \"in small-scale traditional preindustrial societies such as the Kipsigis people of Kenya, where we did research in the 1970s, babies were always in close proximity to caretakers, generally their mother or an older sibling, and they slept anywhere and any time,\" she said.\n\nAround the world, there are not only differences in when babies snooze but in what happens before they slumber.\n\nParents try it all to get babies to sleep\n\nIn the United States, it's common for parents to prepare their children for bedtime with a soothing bath followed by a lullaby or, for older kids, a book.\n\nYet around the world, bedtime routines involve a different approach, and in some places, they appear to be less common.\n\n\"One of the biggest similarities is that most families include in their child's bedtime routine, for 0-3, some type of feeding, whether it's breastfeeding or bottle-feeding or snacks, and that's consistent across all countries, but if we take that out, there's big differences in activities like bathing,\" Mindell said, citing her own research\n\nIn the US, \"60% of families have a bath as part of their bedtime routine. It's even higher in the United Kingdom at 81%. But somewhere like India, only 13%. In Indonesia, it's only 6%,\" she said. \"They typically bathe in the morning or at another time of the day.\"\n\nThere are also regional differences in which bedtime routines include prayers, Mindell added.\n\n\"In the Philippines, 29% of families -- basically one out of three families -- include prayers as part of their bedtime routine,\" she said. \"Whereas some place like Australia, only 6% did. In Indonesia, 30% include prayers as part of their bedtime routine.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Toddler's bedtime prayer caught on baby monitor Replay More Videos ...

Co-sleeping on mats on the floor is a cultural norm in Asia, where the family traditionally co-sleeps together in the same room. Mats are brought out at night, then stored during the day so the same room is both a living room and a sleeping room,\" Harkness said.\n\n\"We found more tolerance for co-sleeping for at least part of the night for babies and young children in European communities we studied, but this may have changed more recently following pediatric advice,\" she said.\n\nIn the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against sharing a bed with your infant and says \"there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of devices promoted to make bed-sharing 'safe.' \"\n\n\"The US parents seem to receive more strict guidance, especially from pediatricians, about avoiding co-sleeping,\" Harkness said. \"This is part of a larger set of advice about sleeping arrangements, including not using padded 'bumpers' around cribs, having the baby sleep on its back and not using covers such as quilts or blankets for babies -- all for the same purpose of avoiding the danger of suffocation.\"\n\n'Bedtime routines are the perfect package'\n\nAll in all, bedtime routines can benefit a child's development , Mindell said.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"Bedtime routines are the perfect package for not only sleep, but for promoting positive child development,\" Mindell said.\n\n\"Children who have consistent bedtime routines not only sleep better, but it also promotes things like literacy, attachment, language, bonding and self-care -- all the things that we want children to have, whether or not they live in India or whether they live in the United States,\" she said.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/05/health/baby-bedtimes-parenting-without-borders-explainer-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-01-05T00:00:00"}, {"title": "When kids get first cell phone around the world", "text": "(CNN) Sara Zaske's daughter, Sophia, rarely showed much interest in having her own cell phone -- that is, until they moved back to the United States from Germany.\n\nAbout six years ago, when Sophia was just a toddler, Zaske and her husband moved the family from Oregon to Berlin.\n\nBy the time Sophia was in third grade in Berlin, almost no one in her class owned a cell phone, let alone a smartphone, Zaske said, and Sophia hardly noticed.\n\n\"At that time, she only knew a few kids who had a phone, and most of those phones were flip phones\" and not connected to the internet, Zaske said.\n\nBut when Zaske and her family moved to California's San Francisco Bay Area, Sophia entered fourth grade and became the only student in her class without a smartphone, Zaske said, and the girl noticed.\n\nParenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.\n\n\"So she tells me, 'I think I might need a phone, Mom.'

In comparison, adults reported spending about 3.8 hours on their phones, according to the study.\n\n\"It seems that Korean children start to have their own mobile phone around second to third grade, and by the time they become fourth-graders, most of them have mobile phones,\" said Yoori Hwang, a researcher at Myongji University in Seoul and lead author of the study.\n\nAmong Taiwanese children, the numbers of those who used cell phones rose steadily from 45% of 11-year-olds to about 71% of 15-year-olds, according to a study published in the Journal of the Formosan Medical Association in 2015.\n\nA wide disparity across cultures\n\nIn Turkey, there was no consensus among parents regarding the best time for their kids to have mobile phones, according to a study published last year in the Interactive Journal of Medical Research . The study involved 333 participants.\n\n\"We asked the parents the optimal time to buy a mobile phone for their children; approximately 19.5% of the parents responded as 6 to 11 years; 59.8% of the parents responded as 12 to 17 years,\" said Dr. Meltem Dinleyici, assistant professor in pediatrics at the Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine and lead author of the study.\n\n\"According to the parent's responses, 3.3% indicated that there was no need for the presence of a mobile phone for children until the age of 18,\" Dinleyici said.\n\nAbout four out of five, or 81%, of secondary school students in South Africa own or have access to a mobile phone, and about 31% have their own social network page, according to a report published by UNICEF in 2013.\n\nAmong children 9 to 18 in Ghana, 18.8% of boys and 12.9% of girls own a mobile phone, according to a study published in the Journal of International Development in 2015. It also showed that among children in Malawi, 10.4% of boys and 6.2% of girls own a mobile phone.\n\nOverall, according to the study, ownership of mobile phones climbed between 2007 and 2014 from about 0.6% to 8.4% in Malawi, 2.4% to 16.2% in Ghana and 21% to 50.8% in South Africa.\n\nIn a study of fourth-year primary school children in Australia, nearly 31% owned or used a mobile phone at the start of the study. A year later, 43% did, according to their parents.\n\nFor the study, published in the journal Environmental Health in June, data were collected on 412 children from 36 schools in Melbourne and Wollongong between 2010 and 2013.\n\n\"Parents were asked at what age their child first owned or used a mobile phone.

Floyd College of Medicine at Washington State University.\n\n\"Overall, however, the impulse and act of infant-directed speech seems to be pretty human, not necessarily culturally defined,\" he said.\n\nHere is a sampling of how moms and dads from around the world use infant-directed speech or \"baby talk,\" and why.\n\nHow baby talk might be consistent\n\nMothers around the world consistently alter their voices when talking to their babies, no matter what language they speak, according to a study published in October in the journal Current Biology\n\nParenting Without Borders considers how parenting trends and methods differ -- or don't -- around the world.\n\nResearchers recorded and analyzed the voices of 24 moms with a powerful machine-learning algorithm.\n\nHalf of the women were English speakers, and the others spoke Spanish, Russian, Polish, Hungarian, German, French, Hebrew, Mandarin and Cantonese.\n\nDespite their native languages, the study showed, all of the women consistently shifted their timbre -- or the tone and sound of their voice -- when interacting with their infants.\n\nThe researchers were surprised that this shift in sound was a consistent pattern across such a diverse range of languages, said Elise Piazza, associate research scholar at Princeton University and lead author of the study.\n\n\"After we controlled for pitch, we still found timbre differences between infant-directed speech and adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said.\n\nThough some similarities have been seen in how mothers speak to babies, studies have also spotted some cultural differences among both moms and dads.\n\nHow baby talk might differ\n\nA study published in February in the journal Child Development found that dads in North America tended to slow their speech when talking to infants, whereas dads in the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu did not. Rather, they tended to shift their pitch more.\n\nResearchers examined 30 interactions between the fathers and their infants, around 7.8 months old. More research is needed in a larger sample of fathers to determine that such differences do, indeed, exist in how these dads baby talk.\n\n\"These are small samples,\" said Greg Bryant, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He conducted the study with Tanya Broesch, assistant professor in the department of psychology at Simon Fraser University\n\n\"The bigger picture is that there are many ways that mothers and fathers can achieve the same communicative effect,\" he said. \"What's universal is that parents often do change their voice when speaking to young children, but how they change exactly could vary across cultures.\"\n\nAs for mothers, a study published last year in the journal PLOS One found a tendency for Lebanese mothers to use more infant-directed speech than American moms.\n\nThe study involved 19 American and 19 Lebanese mothers. The researchers recorded audio of the American moms interacting with their infants in a lab and the Lebanese moms interacting with their infants at home.\n\nThe key difference between the groups was that Lebanese moms had a higher rate in utterances per minute of baby talk than the American moms, the researchers found.\n\nAlthough other research groups have identified differences in baby talk across cultural contexts, this study was the first to report quantitatively on such language differences, the researchers wrote.\n\nStill, the study had some limitations. For instance, American moms were tested in a lab, but Lebanese mothers were tested at home, which could explain the differences.\n\nOn the other hand, it turns out that how babies respond to their parents could vary by culture.\n\nHow babies babble around the globe\n\n\"Babies will often babble with their native sound-sequences,\" VanDam said.\n\n\"For example, we don't have words in English that begin with 'tl,' such as 'tlick,' and English-speaking babies don't tend to babble that way,\" he said, but some Spanish words begin with \"tl.\"\n\n\"We also see sign language babies babbling in sign language, which is fairly strong evidence that it's more of a human trait than some language or culture specific trait,\" VanDam said.\n\nIn other words, as kids develop, their babbling starts to reflect the speech patterns of their native language, Bryant said.\n\nsuggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in Novembersuggested that infants start understanding words around 6 months old.\n\n\"So mothers and fathers exaggerate vowel categories, for example, so they'll make vowel sounds a little more noticeable, and then that helps the infants acquire the vowel sounds of their language,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people also think that exaggerated features in infant-directed speech help kids learn how to parse the syntax of spoken sentences, but that is a little more controversial,\" he said.\n\nThe changes we tend to make in our voices -- such as exaggerated, repetitive and high-pitched baby talk -- could actually be useful for babies' learning, Piazza said.\n\nJUST WATCHED Baby Sign Language Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Baby Sign Language 02:55\n\n\"Previous experiments have shown that infants segment words and learn the meaning of novel words better from infant-directed than adult-directed speech,\" Piazza said.\n\n\"It also seems to help parents capture babies' attention and engage them emotionally,\" she said. \"Adults are generally motivated to engage infants, and they intuitively know that babies respond well to the exaggerated patterns in baby talk. Infant-directed speech is just one example of tailoring your communication style to a particular audience, which we do all the time.\"\n\nWhy we use baby talk\n\nSome scientists argue that baby talk not only helps infants acquire language, it helps parents form a positive emotional bond with their babies, said Linda Polka, a professor in the School of Communication Sciences and Disorders at McGill University in Canada.\n\nOther studies suggest that infants prefer high-pitched infant-directed speech and even infant-directed singing, Polka said.\n\nThe reason for this preference remains complex, but research suggests that when adults shift the sound of their voices for \"baby talk,\" that causes them to sound smaller -- as if their voice is coming from a smaller vocal tract, Polka said.\n\n\"Our research shows that babies prefer to listen to speech coming from a smaller infant talker, but we don't know exactly why babies show this preference. Do they simply have a general 'smaller talkers are better' bias, or are they particularly sensitive to how big an infant is?\" Polka said.\n\nIn the future, \"we could figure this out by assessing how they respond to speech sounds that come from a vocal tract that is too small to be an infant. Would they still like it, or would that be less interesting to them?\" she said.\n\nAdditionally, Polka said that whether you are talking to a baby or an adult, research suggests that there is a tendency to shift your speech to sound more like the person who you are interacting with.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\"You are more likely to do that when you have a positive regard for the person you're interacting with,\" Polka said.\n\n\"Adjusting our speech to sound smaller when we use baby talk may be a way to convey affect to the baby, by trying to sound like them,\" she said. \"At the same time, it can also help them in terms of their own learning, because we're giving them a chance to listen to a voice that sounds more like them. We may be kind of priming them for their own voice, which is quite distinct from an adult voice.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2017/12/07/health/baby-talk-parenting-without-borders-explainer-intl/index.html", "published": "2017-12-07T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Chickpea Pasta: This brand makes a healthy gluten-free pasta that's lower carb, high protein", "text": "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/04/cnn-underscored/banza-chickpea-pasta-shop/index.html?iid=underscoredhealthhpplacement", "published": "2018-03-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Best blood pressure monitors to use at home", "text": "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/19/cnn-underscored/best-blood-pressure-monitors-shop/index.html?iid=underscoredhealthhpplacement", "published": "2018-03-19T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Zoodles: The trick to making zoodles or zucchini noodles is this kitchen device", "text": "Please enable JavaScript for a better experience.", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/28/cnn-underscored/zoodles-pasta-alternative-shop/index.html?iid=underscoredhealthhpplacement", "published": "2018-02-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "How Cesar Manrique helped save Lanzarote from too much tourism", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 People who live in cool-looking underground lairs carved out by molten lava are usually, in Bond movies at least, hellbent on global destruction.\n\nBut on the wild, volcanic landscape of the Canary Islands, one man used his subterranean hideaway, complete with open-air pool and striking artwork, to plot something far better: the preservation of paradise.\n\nThe man was C\u00e9sar Manrique, an irrepressible Spanish artist who spent part of the 1960s hanging in New York with the likes of Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock before returning home to the Atlantic island of Lanzarote with some spectacular ideas.\n\nWhile he may not be as famous as some of his artistic contemporaries, he's arguably responsible for a far greater legacy -- helping save his stunning island from the darker forces of the travel industry.\n\nIn doing so, he foreshadowed today's concerns about global overtourism by nearly half a century.\n\nLanzarote, blessed with a year-round mild spring climate and superb sandy beaches, was threatened by what Manrique called an \"avalanche\" of mass tourism that, had he not made passionate interventions, would've fueled rampant development.\n\nIn the 1970s and '80s, Manrique highlighted the pollution and destruction he began to see on his island.

Even 26 years after his death his presence can be felt across the island.\n\nHe bequeathed a passion for culture that in 2017 saw the opening of the Museo Atl\u00e1ntico Lanzarote, an underwater sculpture park beneath the waves that lap the unspoiled sands of Papagayo, on the island's southern tip.\n\nFor the real C\u00e9sar Manrique experiences visitors need to get out and explore -- and following in the artist's footsteps is a great way to explore the best that Lanzarote's rugged landscape has to offer.\n\nHere's where to go:\n\nFundaci\u00f3n C\u00e9sar Manrique / C\u00e9sar Manrique Foundation\n\nCool pool: Manrique designed his own Volcano House.

Pictured here, former student Chanda Agarwala (formerly Chanda More) sits in the pilot seat during a training session more than four decades ago. Courtesy Banasthali Vidyapith\n\nAt Banasthali Vidyapith, the curriculum is based on the concept of \"Panchmukhi Shiksha,\" which the university describes as the \"harmonious development of personality.\"\n\nThe university offers a wide range of departments, including law, design, science, nanotechnology and literature.\n\nIt introduced its Gliding & Flying Club with a fleet of five aircraft in the 1960s, when only a handful of female pilots existed in the world.\n\nAt first, the aviation training was intended to help women build confidence as part of the schools holistic program.\n\nIt evolved into a School of Aviation, where women could later pursue a student's license, bachelor's degree or a commercial pilot's license.\n\nCaptain Tarana Saxena \u201cThey give girls a chance to learn about aviation ... a chance to fly.\u201d\n\nEven for those who wish to acquire a student pilot's license, rather than pursue aviation as a career, Banasthali provides 5-10 hours of free flying lessons.\n\n\"At a time when it was considered unreal and absurd for women to drive cars in the country, we were teaching girls how to fly,\" Aditya Shastri, grandson of founder Pandit Hiralal Shastri, tells CNN Travel.\n\nOver the years, the aviation school has since turned out many of India's top female pilots, including Avani Chaturvedi, whom the country celebrated as its first female fighter pilot in 2016.\n\nChaturvedi made history again in February, when the 24-year-old became India's first woman to fly a fighter aircraft solo.\n\nA patch of turbulence\n\nCaptain Tarana Saxena poses with beside a Cessna at Banasthali Vidyapith University. Tarana Saxena\n\nGrowing up in the town of Bilari, in Uttar Pradesh, Saxena has had her eyes on the sky ever since her parents gave her a toy airplane when she was about five years old.\n\n\"Even though the toy couldn't actually fly, I remember playing with it, and wondering how these things stayed in the sky,\" says Saxena.\n\nShe lived in a town where there was no airport, not many people spoke English and it was a big deal if a girl rode a bike.\n\n\"Luckily, I grew up with parents who supported me,\" says Saxena. \"One day my father saw an ad for the flying club in the newspaper and he applied for me, when I was still in boarding school [high school].\"\n\nBut pursuing aviation isn't easy. For starters, it's expensive. At least 200 flight hours are required to achieve a commercial pilot's license and each hour costs Rs10,000 ($135).\n\nIn total, the license will cost roughly 20-35 lakh Indian Rupees, or about US$28-47,000, though the university provides scholarship programs.\n\n\"Banasthali is trying to nurture more women leaders in aviation,\" Professor Seema Verma, dean of the School of Aviation, tells CNN Travel.\n\n\"A lot of Indian parents don't want to spend so much on training for their daughters. There are exceptions, of course. Some parents have dreams (for their daughters) in sync with our mission.\"\n\nSaxena says her parents -- her mom, a doctor who works with unprivileged people; her father, a professor -- endured an onslaught of judgment from neighbors, who questioned their investment in a girl.\n\n\"We live in a society where people judge -- why are you spending so much on your daughter? Why are you letting your daughter to that? Girls can't drive. How can they fly?\"\n\nSaxena's parents encouraged her to ignore the noise and follow her dream.\n\n\"No one in my family was ever in the aviation industry.

An instructor accompanied her as she settled into the cockpit of a Cessna 152A, a common training aircraft.\n\n\"I remember my instructor warned me that I might feel dizzy or a little nauseous, but I didn't feel anything but excitement,\" says Saxena.\n\n\"I couldn't believe how amazing it felt to be in the air. I wanted five more minutes, 10 more minutes...I wanted it to last forever.\"\n\nShe says flying felt exactly the way she imagined it.\n\n\"It's rare to dream about something, then have it come true.\"\n\nShe earned her Bachelor's degree in Aviation Science followed by a commercial pilot license, which required a series of eight exams, in about five years.\n\nAfter graduation, Saxena says she fielded job offers from Spicejet, Air Asia & Vistara and, this year, secured her dream job at IndiGo.\n\n\"I chose IndiGo because it has the Airbus 320, which I prefer to fly, and it has the female factor -- Indigo employs the highest number of female pilots in India (with 14%).

Chris Dwyer\n\nThis year marks half a century since the route was first flown. Back in 1968 Continental Micronesia was the carrier, starting a service to connect the remote communities across the vast Micronesia region of the Western Pacific.\n\nToday, United flies direct from Guam to Honolulu, seven hours on a 777. But taking this route means missing out on some of the world's most remote and beautiful countries and territories.\n\nThe Island Hopper has become a bucket-list must for aviation fans keen to discover the tiny airports dotted across this expanse of Pacific. They're happy to fly the route even though most never get further than the tiny, modest airports along the way.\n\nMost regular passengers tend to do no more than a couple of legs, but many of them have fascinating stories to tell about why they're taking the flight, while multiple factors make this one of the world's most unusual routes.\n\nFour pilots\n\nFirst Officer Captain Fitz Fitzgerald on one of his last Island Hopper flights before retiring. Chris Dwyer\n\nFirstly, there are four pilots on board. Two fly from Honolulu to Majuro in the Marshall Islands, while the next two then fly the legs from Majuro to Guam.\n\nFirst Officer Fitz Fitzgerald has just retired after 31 years with United. He's been flying the Island Hopper for four and a half years, after flying 747s for much of his career.\n\n\"I jumped at the chance to live on the island (Guam),\" he tells CNN Travel during one of his last flights. \"I'm from Colorado, it's a long way from the beach! I just fell in love with it.\"\n\n\"I chose to work the Island Hopper almost exclusively. It's a lot of fun, and as a pilot, it's also challenging. This is what flying is all about, from the seat of your pants -- almost. There's no radar, no control towers and GPS gets you within about two miles of the runway, then you've got to find it and line yourself up.\"\n\nAll the smaller islands have short runways with quick turns, while at every stop a fire truck is manned and ready by the side of the runway as they're needed to douse the tires and cool off the brakes between stops.\n\nRelated content These 600 Hawaiian cats have a better life than you\n\nCabin and technical crew\n\nVictor Williams and Anthony Diaz who work on the Island Hopper plane. Chris Dwyer\n\nAlthough neither look old enough, Victor Williams has been working the Island Hopper for 34 years and Anthony Diaz a mere 29.\n\nMost crew need at least a quarter century under their belt before they're considered for the much sought-after route, as flight attendants get a two-day break in Honolulu before the return leg -- a rare perk in the world of modern aviation.\n\nThings may soon change, however, so there's a chance that crew may no longer be able to work the entire 16-hour route. Unlike the pilots, they don't rotate.\n\nTo say they know the route -- and the passengers -- is an understatement. When they started flying it, aboard a 727, there were just two flight attendants for 70 passengers over seven stops -- one more than today.\n\nAs Williams explains: \"There was no inflight entertainment. We were the entertainment! The back half of the cabin was 70 passengers, the front half was cargo so there could be anything from pigs to chickens to vegetables. We've watched people grow up. We're the only one to have this type of routing in the whole airline industry. It's definitely a family.\"\n\nFor the sectors from Majuro to Guam, United also has a Field Technical Representative on board -- a specially trained mechanic -- along with a number of spare parts in the event that a technical fix is needed while on the islands.\n\nA plane with 160 people getting stranded overnight on tiny Kosrae is not an option.\n\nThere are also complicated computations of both people and cargo at each stop, with both needing to be precisely loaded to maintain weight balance.\n\nLeg 1 Honolulu -- Majuro\n\nThe flight leaving Hawaii. Chris Dwyer\n\nBy far the longest leg, this five-hour flight takes off from the Reef Runway at Honolulu's Daniel K Inouye International Airport.\n\nBut not before dozens of cool boxes and white boxes of mail are loaded. The cool boxes are bringing food -- particularly meat -- for residents of the remote islands where fresh meat is scarce and expensive. The mail boxes are another indication of how the route is a lifeline.\n\nAt the gate, posing for a photo, are two airline employees. Based in California, they're heading to tiny Pohnpei for a few days' vacation before then flying on to Guam. They are flight attendants who have always wanted to fly this route.\n\nThe flight takes off on Sunday morning but arrives in Majuro on Monday morning because it crosses the International Date Line, taking us forward a whole day.\n\nFor the entire flight, there's nothing outside but 50 shades of blue.\n\nRelated content Beauty of the everyday: Photos of Earth from a window seat\n\nMajuro, The Marshall Islands\n\nThe harbor in Majuro, the Marshall Islands. Chris Dwyer\n\nYokwe! That's the local greeting in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, a country of more than 100 islands and islets. It receives around 5,000 visitors a year -- 1% of the number who visit North Korea -- almost all of whom arrive on the Island Hopper.\n\nAs the aircraft starts to descend, a thin ring of atoll emerges suddenly in the distance. It looks barely wide enough to support a road, let alone a runway.\n\nAs the brakes are forcefully applied on landing, the waves of the ocean lap gently just meters from the runway. It's a reminder that the country is at enormous risk of rising sea levels, with the average altitude being just seven feet.\n\nGinny Turner, a British teacher arriving to spend a year in the Marshall Islands. Chris Dwyer\n\nUnderneath a sign announcing The Gateway to Micronesia, at the tiny baggage claim where many of those cool boxes reappear, is a woman carrying a British passport.\n\nGinny Turner explains she's just arrived to work as a teacher volunteering with World Teach for a year. She deliberately chose somewhere far removed -- geographically and culturally -- from her home and the school where she teaches near Ipswich, in eastern England.\n\nThere's no chance of getting lost in the Marshall Islands as there's only one road that runs the length of the island. As for shared taxis, they're a bargain at 75 cents per person, regardless of how far you go.\n\nRelated content World's 10 most scenic airport approaches for 2018\n\nThe Robert Reimers hotel -- one of seven places to stay listed on TripAdvisor -- is a comfortable base with views over the azure waters of the bay, where tuna fishing boats transfer their catch to larger vessels. It's a surprise then that the one thing that's off the menu at the hotel restaurant is tuna.\n\nWandering the quiet main street, dotted with a number of Chinese-owned supermarkets and stores, the local museum and adjacent church stand out due to their height, as do three young Mormon men in shirt and tie, despite the heat.\n\nBoarding from Majuro for Island Hopper onwards. Chris Dwyer\n\nInside the museum there's a moving reminder of the plight of many Marshallese, as it chronicles how inhabitants were forced to leave their home islands in the 1940s and '50s when the United States tested dozens of nuclear weapons across the region -- most famously at Bikini Atoll.\n\nA few hundred yards away, next to the island's Post Office, a sign announces the building housing the Nuclear Claims Tribunal.\n\nLeg 2 Majuro - Kwajalein\n\nBack at the airport for the series of flights that eventually reach Guam, the next stop an hour away is the island of Kwajalein, but not before all the passengers are briefed.\n\nIt's home to a US Army installation, the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site. That means no photos of any sort are allowed either on approach, while on the ground, or on takeoff. Everyone deplaning -- including dozens of contractors -- also has to remove any headgear before they do so.\n\nOn board is one of the rare leisure visitors, a Ukrainian diver joining a number of other specialists to explore some of the region's numerous World War II wrecks. Sites including Prinz Eugen, the escort ship to Germany's legendary Bismarck battleship, have made it a sought-after destination for experienced wreck divers. On landing he'll get on a boat for a 26 hours journey to Bikini Atoll.\n\nOn the next takeoff 45 minutes later, the Ukrainian diver's seat is taken by a laid-back electrical contractor from Montana who explains that he works \"on missile silos\" -- without divulging much more.\n\nLeg 3 Kwajalein - Kosrae\n\nThe descent into Kosrae. Chris Dwyer\n\nNext stop is Kosrae, an island of the Federated States of Micronesia which is only visited in three of the four weekly Island Hopper flights. On approach, there are breathtaking and picture-perfect desert islands surrounded by aquamarine waters dotted across the ocean, before suddenly mountains appear on the horizon and a lush green island comes into view, fringed by golden stretches of sand.\n\nThe firetruck on standby at Kosrae Airport. Chris Dwyer\n\nThe breaks slam on as the aircraft touches the 5,750-foot airstrip -- less than half the length of a runway at Heathrow.\n\nAs passengers stretch their legs -- and some aviation fans ask immigration officials if they can get a passport stamp despite not officially entering the country -- it's time to stock up on snacks.\n\nPassengers bemoan the lack of food on board the Island Hopper -- in coach, breakfast is served from Honolulu to Majuro, but then there's only a light snack from Chuuk to Guam around seven hours later. While logistics factors doubtless come into play, it's a complaint heard time and again from passengers -- that and the cost of the ticket, around $2,300 round trip, subject to seat availability and seasonality. (The return leg from Guam to Honolulu can be taken on a 777 as a direct flight).\n\nKosrae International Airport. Chris Dwyer\n\nIt also means that regular fliers stock up with snacks in advance and along the way. In Kosrae, it's fair to say there are pretty slim pickings. Aside from some chips and candy, one table offers a sole spam musubi -- that's rice topped with spam and wrapped in seaweed, sushi-style -- a number of small bananas and local coconut oil in plastic bottles.\n\nLeg 4 Kosrae - Pohnpei\n\nThe scenery of Pohnpei island. Chris Dwyer\n\nIn common with all the islands en route, beautiful Kosrae is a tempting place to spend a few days. But there's no hanging around. Next up is Pohnpei, one hour behind Kosrae but still part of the Federates States of Micronesia.\n\nPohnpei from the sky. Chris Dwyer\n\nOnce again, after descending over multicolored patches of atoll, a runway appears out of nowhere, while mist-covered mountains have more than a touch of \"Jurassic Park\" about them. Parts of Pohnpei are some of the wettest on earth, with Mount Nanlaud receiving around 400 inches of rain every year.\n\nParts of Pohnpei are some of the wettest places on Earth. Chris Dwyer\n\nPohnpei is also home to the mysterious Nan Madol ruins, called by some the Venice of the Pacific, as it was a city of man-made islands built around channels filled by the oceans, a site that once housed an ancient civilization.\n\nCaptain Fitz Fitzgerald, joining passengers on a walk around the departure area, recommends picking up two local specialties from the small stall -- flavored salts and coconut oil.\n\nBack on board, the flight attendant Williams approves of the latter purchase, saying his 84-year-old father swears by it.\n\nLeg 5 Pohnpei - Chuuk\n\nEven splitting up the Island Hopper journey with a night in the Marshall Islands, fatigue definitely sets in after three takeoffs and landings.\n\nThe penultimate stop comes at Chuuk, another destination that is world-renowned among divers. That's due to more than 60 wrecks of both aircraft and ships, known as the Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon, which serve as a reminder of brutal battles in World War II.\n\nLifeline: When needed, part of the plane can be curtained off to carry patients to hospital. Chris Dwyer\n\nIt's also where another pilot explains the lifeline often played by the Island Hopper. In such remote islands with very limited medical infrastructure, UA154 is often used to transport patients to and from hospitals in Guam.\n\nWhen needed, there's even a special curtained-off area to allow stretchers to rest across the front row of seats in coach.\n\nRelated content The world's most beautiful island hotels\n\nLeg 6 Chuuk - Guam\n\nThe view of natural reefs from the Dusit Thani Guam resort.

A former flight attendant for United Airlines, Pattison later worked in PR for the airport and now manages the collection at LAX's Flight Path Learning Center and Museum.\n\nFrom convincing the airport officials that a newer, bigger airport was needed after the advent of the jet engine, to hobnobbing with The Beatles when they landed in LA in 1964, Pattison chatted to CNN Travel about her incredible aviation career.\n\nLAX growth\n\nAn airplane pilot and a flight attendant greeting the driver of a 1963 Corvette Sting Ray Sport Coupe.

She worked for a nylon hosiery company for a couple of years, before she decided to pursue a career in aviation.\n\n\"I had a sorority sister that was a stewardess for United Airlines,\" says Pattison.\n\n\"I was inspired and so I was hired by United in 1951 in July and then I flew for a year and a quarter.\"\n\nPattison quickly fell in love with flying, although she never got to travel outside of the US.\n\n\"You have to realize there were no jets, it was all propellers,\" she recalls. \"DC-3s, [DC-4s], DC-6, DC-6B and then the jets did not come till 1959.\"\n\nLAX historian Ethel Pattison pictured in her flight attendant days.

That was 1956. It had been defeated twice before so we had an uphill battle, so we went to the grassroots and educated the children, had them tell their parents.\n\nAnd so the measure, the bond measure, won eight to one.

While the decision was applauded in Kiev, some tied the cancellation to the Trump's domestic political problems. Hours before Trump pulled the plug on the sit-down with Putin, new allegations surfaced involving his former longtime attorney Michael Cohen , once again prompting questions about Trump's financial ties to Russia. \"Was the provocation organized by Kiev in this region the real reason for cancellation?\" Zakharova, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said in a press conference Friday, Russian state news agency RIA reported. \"Publicly, we heard just such an explanation, we took note of it. Is this a reality? I think that you still need to look for answers in the US domestic political situation. The dominant factor in making a decision is domestic political realities in the US,\" she suggested. The Kremlin also said it regretted the US administration's decision to cancel the meeting but left the door open to reschedule the appointment. \"As far as Russian President Vladimir Putin is concerned, he is ready for contacts with his US counterpart,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS on Friday.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/30/europe/ukraine-russia-border-ban-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T00:00:00"}, {"title": "'I'm scared for the future of my baby here'", "text": "Paris (CNN) In a Parisian suburb, Myriam sits at her parents' dinner table, the Shabbat candles flickering before her. Together with her husband and newborn son she takes stock of the painful week she's had. It's a regular conversation for many French Jews.\n\nMyriam, who did not want to give her last name over fears for her own safety, questions whether France is a country where her family can prosper, a place they can still call home.\n\nAccording to the Jewish Agency for Israel, 55,000 French Jews have left the country since the year 2000.\n\n\"I'm scared of the future of my baby here,\" Myriam told CNN.\n\n\"I hope that he will have a future here, and you know Jewish communities are a part of the history of France.\"\n\nMyriam's family gather for Shabbat dinner in a Paris suburb.\n\nEarlier this month, the French government said that anti-Semitic acts had increased by 69% over the first nine months of 2018. The new statistics coincided with the announcement of a 5 million euro government fund to combat anti-Semitism in schools and a pledge to tackle online hate speech.\n\nFrederic Potier, the man charged with leading the government's plans to tackle anti-Semitism, said the poll's findings were shocking.\n\n\"I'm really surprised by this number because in our country... 20% is a lot,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked by CNN as to why the number was so high, he answered: \"I will not say that we don't have any problems, yes we do. We have some problems, some teachers have difficulties to teach the Holocaust.\"\n\n20% of 18- to 34-year-olds polled have never heard of the Holocaust in France Source: CNN/ComRes poll 2018\n\nArthur Reverchon, a history teacher who works with children in Paris, says Holocaust education is a large part of the program in secondary schools and often comes up in exams.\n\n\"The history curriculum taught to kids between the ages of 11-13 deals largely with the birth of Judaism. With regards to anti-Semitism in France, the Dreyfus affair is on the curriculum in middle school (13-14) and in high school (16-17), this allows us to delve into the issue of anti-Semitism in France and in Europe. The Holocaust constitutes a large part of the program in secondary school.\"\n\n\"On the whole, I think the Holocaust is well taught in the curriculum and it's wrong to say it's difficult to teach the Holocaust in French schools, particularly in the suburbs,\" Reverchon told CNN.\n\n\"I taught in three different schools, all three were difficult and in the suburbs, but I never had any difficulty teaching the Holocaust, my students were always receptive. If there are examples, and I'm not denying their existence, they are globally isolated events.\"\n\nViolent attacks\n\nSince 2006, when Ilan Halimi, a young Jewish man, was kidnapped and killed, 11 people have died in anti-Semitic attacks in France.\n\nIn 2017, Sarah Halimi, a 65-year-old Orthodox Jewish woman, was murdered in her apartment, dragged from her bed and thrown from the balcony in an anti-Semitic attack which shocked the nation.\n\nEarlier this year, hundreds took to the streets to protest after Mireille Knoll, an 85-year-old French Holocaust survivor, was slain in her apartment in what French authorities have described as an anti-Semitic hate crime.\n\nAn undated photograph of Mireille Knoll (R), provided to CNN by her granddaughter Jessica Knoll (L).\n\nThat list of fatal attacks almost included Nathaniel Azoulay, an 18-year-old Parisian who told CNN how he was attacked by a man wielding a saw after a traffic altercation. Azoulay says the man had been civil toward him initially.\n\n\"He was talking to me normally, but at some point, his speech changed when he saw the kippah,\" said Azoulay, referring to his head covering.\n\nThe man's aggression prompted Azoulay and his brother to flee their car, running as fast as they could toward safety. Though both trained in Krav Maga, the self-defense system used by the Israel Defense Forces and taught in Jewish community centers in France, neither could escape the assailant.\n\n\"He started hurling anti-Semitic insults, 'f***king Jew, you're gonna die on this road,'\" said Azoulay. \"He wanted us to die... he stabbed my brother with the saw and my brother could not protect himself with his Krav Maga moves.\"\n\nAzoulay says he tried to save his brother, who had been pushed to the floor with the saw aimed at his neck, but a group of the attacker's friends arrived and surrounded the siblings.\n\n\"The attacker was shouting: 'They're f***ing Jews we can beat up, come, hit them,'\" said Azoulay.\n\n\"We tried to run back to the car. He attacked me again with the saw on my back but I had a big jacket. His friends were going towards my brother and pushing him on the ground. I managed to grab the saw. I grabbed the sharp side so it cut my fingers and I had to get it stitched up at the hospital.\"\n\nAzoulay says the attack came to a halt only after the father of the attacker pleaded with his son to stop.\n\nAzoulay's brother was injured in the attack and police investigated. But a trial has yet to begin.\n\nThe relationship between the two communities has deteriorated steadily as the politics of the Middle East has reverberated in France.\n\nIt's visible in the working-class Parisian suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, which once had a thriving Jewish community.\n\nThe community center and synagogue were once full. But a member of the community told CNN the numbers have dropped dramatically.\n\nFear has forced many to leave for other parts of Paris or in some cases, leave the country altogether.\n\nJUST WATCHED CNN poll reveals anti-Semitism is alive and well in Europe Replay More Videos ...

They have nothing to do with what's going on in Palestine. They are afraid for their children and that's crazy.\"\n\nThe turning point\n\nYonathan Arfi, vice president of CRIF, an umbrella body for Jewish groups in France, says there have been \"several hundred attacks\" since 2000, with the nature of those attacks changing markedly.\n\nHe cites the start of the second intifada in the West Bank and Gaza in 2000 as the moment the attacks on the Jewish community began to change.\n\n\"Before it was graffiti on buildings, now it ends up with (the) killing of people and terrorism, so we see that the nature of anti-Semitism has changed dramatically,\" said Arfi.\n\n\"These attacks were committed by young people identifying with Palestinians considering Jews guilty of the things happening in the Middle East, I would say.\"\n\nWhile traditional anti-Semitism is not a new phenomenon in France, the government is battling against what has been coined as the \"new anti-Semitism,\" which it says spills out of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nPotier says there is a divergence between both the \"old\" and \"new\" strains of anti-Semitism, which are equally destructive.\n\n\"What we call in France the new anti-Semitism is coming from radical Muslims, but as I say every day, the new anti-Semitism uses very old messages like the Protocol of the Elders of Zion, the theory that Jews have money and power,\" Potier said. \"... both are completely linked. There is a common point between the far-right and radical Muslims.\n\n\"When you are talking about Jews and money for instance, it is the same clich\u00e9, it is the same stereotypes that are being used by these groups. So, when you are educating people, about religious beliefs, what is Israel, what is Zionism, you are using the same tools.\"\n\nHakim El Karoui, a senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne who has previously worked for the French Ministry for Economy and Finance and has advised the government on anti-Semitism, says the lack of familiarity between the two communities is a huge factor in creating tension.\n\nIncreasing segregation between the communities is a dangerous reality that is leading to even less interaction and understanding between communities, often prompting more tension, he says.\n\n\"What has happened in a lot of working-class neighborhoods is that where Arab and Jews once lived together, the Jews have left,\" El Karoui told CNN.\n\n\"They (the Jewish community) left Seine-Saint-Denis, they went to the west side of Paris and therefore they don't know each other anymore,\" El Karoui said.\n\n\"I'm pretty worried about the deterioration of the situation and I think the best answer to this issue should obviously be coming from the government but also from the Muslim community.\n\n\"It needs to say out loud: 'You have no right to say this.' It needs to say, 'You are wrong. You are making a mistake by saying this because in the end your words will come back against you.' The fact that there's a lot of silence on this topic is a problem.\"\n\nThe government hopes its new plan can begin to tackle the roots of anti-Semitism within France.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the mobilization of a national team tasked with educating children in schools across the country on the dangers of anti-Semitism.\n\nHe also promised to make tackling online hate speech a national priority, as well as introducing an anti-racism prize named after Halimi, a 23-year-old tortured and murdered in an anti-Semitic attack in 2006. There are also plans for an online complaint procedure to allow users to register attacks with authorities.\n\nMyriam's family sit down together for Shabbat dinner in a Parisian suburb.\n\nBut For Myriam and her family, the question of whether her son can live safely in the country of his birth remains a difficult one.\n\nThe violence toward France's Jewish community scares her, and while she says the government has tried to act, she is clear that more needs to be done.\n\n\"For over 10 years, the government makes efforts, for sure, in terms of legislation and policies, but it's not enough,\" she says.\n\n\"The first priority is to recognize that the problem, the heart of the problem, it's the radical Islam. First, name the problem.

So, for more than a month, hundreds of pastors and volunteers from across the country have been meeting to maintain the 24/7 service in support of an Armenian family whose asylum claim has been rejected.\n\nTheo Hettema, chairman of the General Council of Protestant Ministers in the Netherlands, told CNN the service will continue \"as long as it's necessary.\"\n\n\"We want to love God and our neighbor. And we thought that this was a clear opportunity to put the love for our neighbor into reality,\" he said.\n\nThe Tamrazyan family, including three children Hayarpi, Warduhi and Seyran, fled Armenia and have been living in the Netherlands since April 2010 while their claim for political asylum was being decided. But their case was rejected, and they've now been told to leave the country.\n\nRead More\n\nHayarpi Tamrazyan, now aged 21, says she is \"incredibly happy and grateful to all volunteers.\" Since the service started, Hayarpi has been posting regular updates on Twitter, thanking people for taking part in the service.

'There is a solution' The Tamrazyan family's only hope now is for government intervention. Under Dutch law, there is a provision for a so-called children's pardon for those who have been living in the Netherlands for more than five years. However, Martine Goeman, who is a legal adviser at Defense for Children in the Netherlands, says most applications are declined. She says there are about 400 children who are in a similar situation to the Tamrazyans, although it's hard to get exact numbers from the government. Rugby team rallies against deportation of gay player to Kenya \"There is a lot of scientific research done which shows that after 5 years, a child cannot be deported without significant damage to their development\" she told CNN by phone. She described the 24/7 service at Bethel church as \"quite powerful\" adding that it points to a groundswell in community support for children in similar situations. \"It's not only the church -- it's also the broader community,\" she said. \"The Minister for Migration could solve (the situation) in one day -- by using his discretionary powers. There is a solution.\" In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for Dutch migration minister Mark Harbers declined to comment on the Tamrazyan's case.

It is the core of Russia's strategy.\n\nIt has been for the four years of the war, and we should by now have stopped acting surprised by Russian pragmatism and adventurism. It's almost impossible to predict this accurately.\n\nFive basics explain how the situation got to where it is now and how it's hard to know where it goes next.\n\nFirst is that this is not a new war. It's not even an uptick of violence in the war. Fighting has persisted since the so-called Minsk accords of 2015. Shelling has happened almost daily along the frontline between Ukraine proper and the separatist areas of the Donbass -- and happened before and after the Kerch incident at the same rate.\n\nPeople have died on both sides every week. The world simply didn't pay attention until the Russian military made the drastic step of overtly confronting the Ukrainian navy on Sunday. This is important to understand, as it explains why flare-ups like the Kerch Strait can turn into full-scale warfare in days, because both sides are armed, are ready for conflict, and have residual pools of loathing built up over 50+ months of fighting.\n\nSecond is that the Russian strategy is based on masking their moves and keeping their opponent off-balance. Russian military drills along the southern border happen now with sufficient regularity that it's hard for Western observers to work out what's a lurch toward war and what's just training.\n\nThe Russians have slowly been sending supplies into Eastern Ukraine -- the Donetsk's People's Republic (DNR) -- for years now. The leader of the DNR, Alexander Zakharchenko, was killed in a bomb blast a few months ago, leading many analysts to remind us that the swift departure of separatist leaders has occurred in the past before upticks in activity in the war. But even that is not a pattern that makes this predictable.\n\nWestern intelligence assessments of Russian President Vladimir Putin see him not as the master long-term strategist, but as the ultimate pragmatist and opportunist. He sees what he can get away with and then does a little more or doesn't.\n\nThe analogy of Putin as the geopolitical student of judo -- his favorite sport -- is tired, but apt. He sees what his opponent has overlooked -- or doesn't care about -- and exploits it. Only this fight is about sovereignty in the European mainland, not two sweaty men in robes.\n\nThird is that Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko doesn't have a strategy, and frankly it's hard to see how someone in his position could.\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump refuses to condemn Russia on Ukraine Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump refuses to condemn Russia on Ukraine 03:01\n\nThis has long ailed Ukraine. It is the malaise of power in Kiev: Corruption; oligarchy; under-resourced forces; infighting in a tired elite. All of it has hamstrung Ukraine's response to repeated Russian invasions.\n\nIf you need a sign of how small and internecine the political hierarchy here is, remember that Poroshenko is behind in the polls for the March presidential elections to Yulia Tymoshenko. She was a key figure in the anti-Russian-influence protests of 2004, known as the Orange Revolution. It's the same faces, often with the same old problems.\n\nThe job of Ukrainian president is not enviable. It is about managing a slow bleed. Moscow wants to retain influence on your nation, or at the least make it so weak it cannot ever imagine joining NATO or the EU. NATO and the EU want you to resist this, but have absolutely no intention of setting red lines deep enough that they end up sending troops to fight in your defense.\n\nInternally, your public is increasingly furious with the destructive mess and slow harvesting of your territory by Russia. And your armed forces simply can't modernize fast enough to be a genuine match for Moscow's.\n\nEven Wednesday's introduction of martial law was desperately confusing in practical application: are Russian citizens banned from entering Ukraine? Will there be a blockade on separatist areas? What does martial law look like and what does it change? If you do nothing, do you further provoke Russia, or do you actually provoke Russia if you do something?\n\nFew people know and as I write this, two hours in, it's still unclear what martial law has changed. It seems that as Ukraine's president, whatever you do, you lose.\n\nFourth is that Putin really needs this. If you ever wonder why the Russian leader would go to all this trouble, recall that this is in his DNA.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union was to him the \"greatest political catastrophe of the 20th century,\" not an inevitable twist of economics. Russia has been involved in US elections -- and perhaps in Brexit, Hungary, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Africa, spy poisonings in Salisbury, espionage attempts in the OPCW, all since 2016. They show that Putin wants to restore the outsized global reach that the dwindling Soviet economy had during the Cold War. This is about prestige and vengeance. About restoring former glory. And he doesn't have term limits, or a legislative or judiciary, holding him back.\n\nFinally -- and this is the big one that could have people really worried -- is US President Donald Trump.\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama refused to send combat troops or risk military engagement in Ukraine. But he got the world behind sanctions and led the charge of fierce condemnation at a time when many European states actually could have done without the headache of worsening ties to Moscow.\n\nObama's line was not militaristic, but it was firm and it damaged the Russian economy -- and with it, Putin's standing. Now, Moscow makes the brazen move of an avoidable yet open military-on-military attack in the Azov Sea -- rather than using proxy separatists or guises -- and the White House is muted on the issue.\n\nTrump spoke out against \"aggression,\" said he was \"not happy\" and might cancel a meeting with Putin. Yet remarkably the meeting was not outright canceled as a matter of course, and is still on the table days after the Kerch incident. In fact, his national security adviser John Bolton seemed keener to confirm it than condemn Russian actions, and omitted Ukraine from the list of things the two men would discuss. When asked about Ukraine, Bolton pointed reporters back to the recent statement of UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. There appears to be a strange phobia of outspoken criticism of Moscow from inside the grounds of the White House -- like stern words against Putin might result in anaphylactic shock. And Trump's unhappiness extends \"either way\" -- suggesting he could hold both Ukraine and Russia responsible. When Putin evaluates the global signals, assesses how far he has gone and how much further he might go, this is the key variable in his mind.\n\nAnd then, you can be sure, the Russians will do exactly the opposite of what seemed inevitable, and wait. Or act suddenly. The inability to predict their next move is the point.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/europe/no-one-knows-what-russia-will-do-next-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Medieval London murder map reveals the city's deadliest spots", "text": "(CNN) There were many ways a person could meet a violent death in medieval London, from violent mob punishment (for littering eel skins) to getting wounded in a fracas (by a servant shooting arrows into a crowd).\n\nThat's according to University of Cambridge criminologist Manuel Eisner, who has plotted 142 cases of murder in the British capital onto an interactive, online death map of 14th-century London.\n\nThe academic used coroner rolls from 1300 to 1340 -- with records of accidents, suicides and homicides -- to help identify the deadliest spots in the old city of London, according to the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge\n\n\"It was a society where conflicts could erupt, where male honor and a sense of having to be able to defend yourself played an important role, where many young men would have a weapon with them -- a sword, a knife or fighting stick\" Eisner told CNN.\n\n\"It was not a society,\" he said, \"where a lot of robberies were going on.\"\n\nRead More\n\n10 of London's oldest, greatest pubs The bloodiest areas of the capital included a stretch of Cheapside, between St. Paul's Cathedral and St. Mary-le-Bow church.

Eisner, whose research featured prominently in Steven Pinker's book, \"The Better Angels of Our Nature,\" said his favorite murder happened near Cheapside, where an adolescent killed a man with a pollaxe after the victim told him off for spilling urine on another young man. \"I like it because you get an idea of the smells and sounds of central London,\" he said. \"You get a sense of the kinds of daily conflict.\" Eisner found the majority -- 68% -- of killings happened on London's streets and at its markets. And, like today, the medieval homicide rate increased over weekends, with almost a third of murders happening on Sundays. The murder rate in medieval London, which had a population of between 40,000 and 100,000, was as much as to 20 times higher as that of a contemporary British town of that size, the academic suggested. But he warned against comparing it too much to modern Britain. The world now has firearms and emergency services, making it easier to kill today but also a lot \"easier to save lives,\" he said in a statement. \"Over 18% of victims survived at least a week after the initial trauma, probably dying eventually from infections or blood loss,\" said Eisner of victims in the 14th century.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/28/uk/london-murder-map-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "UK student to be charged after Syrian refugee attacked", "text": "London (CNN) A teenage boy is to be charged with assault after a video emerged of a Syrian refugee being attacked in the grounds of a UK school.\n\nIn the video, the 15-year-old Syrian boy is taunted, grabbed by the throat and pushed to the ground, as other students look on.\n\nIt was not clear who shot the video of the incident, which occurred last month at a school in Huddersfield, northern England.\n\nThe video prompted widespread condemnation, and an online fundraising effort had reached \u00a375,000 (about $95,000) by Wednesday afternoon, a day after being launched.\n\nWest Yorkshire police said Wednesday that a 16-year-old youth had been interviewed and reported for summons for assault, and that he would appear at a juvenile court in due course.\n\nRead More\n\n\"The incident occurred on 25 October this year and has been subject to thorough investigation since it was reported to us the day after.

It's the online chat rooms where people peddle conspiracy theories that Jewish \"globalists\" run the world.\n\nIt can be violent or subtle. Overt or insidious. Political or personal. It can come from the right or the left. It exists in countries that have large Jewish populations, like France, and it also flourishes in places with smaller Jewish communities, like Poland.\n\nBut one thing is clear. Anti-Semitism is alive and well across Europe. This was the glaring conclusion of a CNN investigation, based in part on a survey of more than 7,000 adults across seven European countries.\n\nDespite Europe's troubling history with anti-Semitism, ugly, old stereotypes persist across the continent.\n\nMore than a quarter of Europeans surveyed believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance. One in five say they have too much influence in media and politics. In individual countries the numbers are often higher: 42% of Hungarians think Jews have too much influence in finance and business across the world.\n\nWhile 44% of Europeans agree that anti-Semitism is a growing problem, a substantial minority is unsympathetic to the problem. Almost one in five (18%) agree that most anti-Semitism in their country is a response to the \"everyday behavior of Jewish people.\" In Poland, 50% of people think that Jews use the Holocaust to advance their position; 19% of Hungarians admit to having an unfavorable impression of Jews altogether.\n\nSo why is anti-Semitism a growing phenomenon once again? Poland's Chief Rabbi, Brooklyn-born Michael Schudrich, is not sure the problem ever really went away.\n\n\"There will always be people who had anti-Semitic feelings and I don't know if the number has grown but this new situation today is they feel that it's more acceptable socially that they can express these opinions out loud...\n\n\"The feeling beforehand was, 'This is what I believe but don't tell anyone.' It was not perfect but at least there was a social taboo against anti-Semitism.\"\n\nCNN saw this at first hand in Germany, a country still haunted by the killing of some six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Making anti-Semitic comments can be punishable under German law. And yet, at a rally of hundreds of right-wing extremists in the nation's capital, Berlin, we saw a man brazenly flash a Nazi salute, an act that could have landed him up to three years in jail. Another protester told us that a shadowy cabal of Jewish globalists runs the world.\n\nThe arrival of some 1.4 million refugees in Germany has energized the far right. The focus of their anger may be Muslim migrants, but they are reflexively anti-Semitic in their views. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, once considered a fringe element, now holds a solid 94 seats in parliament. Its message is clear: you don't have to be ashamed of being angry, you don't have to be ashamed of being white, you don't have to be ashamed of your past.\n\nBut the rise of the far right is only part of the picture. Based on dozens of interviews with members of various Jewish communities across Europe, it is clear that the threat is being felt from many sides.\n\nIn France, many Jews talk about the \"new anti-Semitism,\" coming from radical elements of France's growing Muslim population, which can be felt on the streets of Paris' working-class suburbs.\n\nA happy life is a hidden life, we were told again and again by French Jews who refused to appear on camera. More and more Jewish families are moving out of these traditionally mixed neighborhoods -- a concern for the French government, which believes that integration, not separation, is key to improving the situation.\n\nIn Germany, the leader of Berlin's Kahal Adass Jisroel community organization, Doron Rubin, told me there is also concern about anti-Semitism coming from Muslim refugees, \"who have a different history and a different background, especially obviously coming from the Middle East, and who have, also because of Israel, a different attitude towards Jews.\"\n\nThe nexus between negative attitudes toward Israel and anti-Semitism is a particularly thorny issue.\n\nMore than a quarter of French people have a somewhat or significantly unfavorable impression of Jews as a result of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. This impression is by no means limited to Muslims. Across the continent, many Jews we interviewed spoke of anti-Semitism coming from the left, which is often strongly critical of Israel.\n\nViewed as whole, it is a complex picture, made up of a confluence of different factors with no obvious, one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nFelix Klein has called the results of the CNN poll into anti-Semitism \"appalling.\"\n\nGermany has appointed an anti-Semitsm czar, Felix Klein, who is working on creating a nationwide network for reporting anti-Semitsm and on improving education and integration in schools. Elsewhere, France is spending millions of dollars trying to combat anti-Semitic hate speech online.\n\nMany agree that Holocaust education is an important step. Half of Europeans say that commemorating the Holocaust helps to combat anti-Semitism. And yet, frighteningly, the memory of the Holocaust is starting to fade.\n\nMore than a third of Europeans have either never heard of or know just a little about the Holocaust. That number is even higher when you look at the younger generation. In France, 20% of young adults have never even heard of the Holocaust.\n\nWhen I asked Rabbi Schudrich how he feels about these numbers, he paused a moment before responding, \"It makes me feel I have more work to do.\"\n\nEurope should pay attention.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/europe/anti-semitism-analysis-ward-intl/index.html", "published": "2018-11-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Diners moo vegan protesters out of steakhouse", "text": "(CNN) As plant-based diets boom in popularity, one group of vegan activists took a direct approach to convincing more people to stop eating meat, escalating their tactics in what they say will be regular protests.\n\nSome 20 protesters stormed Touro steakhouse on Saturday in the English seaside resort of Brighton, with one saying, \"This smells horrible, look at all the flesh,\" a Facebook Live video of the episode shows.\n\nThen, as one protester makes a speech, diners shout her down, with some making mooing sounds to drown out her voice.\n\n\"It's not meat, it's violence,\" shout the demonstrators.\n\nProtesters then play recordings of screaming animals but the tenor of the room changed when some patrons started to shout and chant, the video shows.\n\nRead More\n\n\"You're not singing anymore,\" a popular chant at soccer matches around the United Kingdom, rings out around the restaurant as the demonstrators move their protest outdoors.

But her rapist, identified by the UK Press Association as Arshid Hussain, was listed by the council as a respondent even though he did not have parental responsibility nor was he listed as the boy's father on his birth certificate, the Times reports. Woodhouse was told during a court hearing that her abuser was consulted on the case and that he would be allowed to attend court and seek legal representation.

The Ministry of Justice told CNN that this is \"obviously a very distressing incident\" and confirmed that national government and local authorities are working together urgently to understand and address what happened. \"Local authorities can apply to courts to request permission not to notify parents without parental responsibility about care proceedings, and courts should consider the potential harm to the child and mother when making this decision,\" the ministry said in a statement. Although Hussain never made an application to see the child, Woodhouse said a law change will help protect other victims around Britain. \"This is happening all over the country and it needs to stopped,\" Woodhouse, who speaks widely on child sex exploitation and has written a book on the subject , said in the video. It is not clear whether this case is the result of an error by the council or indicates a wider problem with the law, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) told the Press Association. 1,400 cases of 'appalling' sexual exploitation revealed in UK report. Hussain was the ringleader of a child abuse gang and was jailed in 2016 for 35 years after being convicted of 23 child sex offenses. A 2014 report found that hundreds of children had been systematically raped, beaten and sex trafficked in Rotherham for more than 12 years.

Muller's parents were taken to Westerbork in 1941, when he was 5 years old, according to his own website . From there, they were taken on to Auschwitz, where they were killed. Muller's mother had been picked up in a raid shortly after she dropped him off at kindergarten; he survived the rest of the war in hiding. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Dutch government set up the camp at Westerbork, in the country's northeast, in 1939 to hold Jewish refugees who had entered the Netherlands illegally, many from Germany. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940, Westerbork served from 1942 to 1944 as a transit camp for Dutch Jews before they were deported to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland. A Dutch Holocaust survivor lays flowers with her granddaughters at Westerbork in 2010 to mark the 65th anniversary of the liberation of the Dutch transit camp. Between July 1942 and September 3, 1944, the Germans deported 97,776 Jews from Westerbork, nearly 55,000 of them to Auschwitz and more than 34,000 to Sobibor, according to the USHMM. Most of them were killed on arrival. The decision by NS is not without precedent. In 2014, France signed an agreement with US authorities to pay $60 million to Holocaust survivors transported by rail to concentration camps.

To that end, he looked to old statues of Nefertiti, ancient Chinese paintings, Audrey Hepburn and even his wife as inspiration.

Courtesy Istanbul New Airport\n\nCNN Travel asked three European aviation experts to weigh in on how Istanbul's new airport might impact the transport world.\n\n'The project is unprecedented'\n\n\"From an airport planning perspective, the project is unprecedented, both in terms of its size (the eventual plan is for the airport to accommodate 200 million passengers, which is nearly double the size of the current largest airport in the world, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport) and, in particular, the speed with which the project was attempted.\n\nTo complete an airport project of this size in just three and a half years was extremely challenging, not least in terms of ensuring timely operational readiness of all related facilities, systems, procedures and equipment needed to run the airport (Berlin's Brandenburg Airport provides a stark example of what can go wrong with a new airport project like this).\n\nPolitically, it is important for Turkey, President Erdogan, and his party, opening on the 95th anniversary of the foundation of the Turkish Republic. Building a new airport is inevitably a vastly expensive undertaking (reportedly around $12 billion), and there have been concerns around the coincidence of this with a general downturn in the Turkish economy. There have also been ethical concerns raised about labor practices involving the thousands of workers needed to the complete the project on time.\n\nWhile there will likely be challenges ahead, there are several factors acting in the airports favor, including the relatively strong existing domestic air transport market in Turkey (which rivals in the Middle East generally do not have to the same extent), and the fact that the airport is less likely to face the same degree of potentially constraining environmental legislation, which is generally the case for large airports in Western Europe.\n\nRegardless, the airport will certainly have an impact (one way or another) for air transport both within the region and globally.\" --\n\nDr Thomas Budd, Lecturer in Airport Planning and Management, Centre for Air Transport Management, Cranfield University, UK\n\nRelated content How Asia's airports are changing the way we travel\n\n'Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly'\n\nPlanes on the tarmac at Istanbul Airport on October 29, ahead of the inauguration. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"The new airport is taking over from Istanbul Atat\u00fcrk Airport, which is already in the world's top 20 busiest airports. So effectively it's the same situation as if Atat\u00fcrk (which is a congested airport with sometimes significant delays) was expanded. It's quite unusual to see a large airport expansion in Europe but much more in line with recent significant capacity expansions in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nProjected growth rates in aviation demand between Europe and and the Middle East/Asia are very high (for example Boeing projects demand in 20 years' time between Europe and the Middle East to be 2.6 times what it is at present in terms of passenger-km, and 3 times for trips from Europe to China). So the new airport is trying to act as a hub for some of that traffic as well as serving increases in demand to and from Turkey (the Turkish aviation system has grown rapidly in recent years). In doing so it's competing with other large hub airports in the Middle East and Europe for long-distance passengers.\n\nIn the short term the main impact will be smaller delays for passengers traveling to, from and via Istanbul and greater flexibility for airlines using the airport, which may in turn mean some increases in overall passenger demand. Longer term, the outcome is more difficult to predict. But capacity expansion is typically constrained in European airports and much less so for Middle Eastern airports, so we might see some European airport transfer passenger traffic switch to Istanbul.\n\nAs to whether the airport will become one of the world's busiest: given that it is taking over all of the traffic from an existing airport that is already one of the world's busiest, this seems very likely. Aviation demand in Turkey is growing rapidly and long-distance passenger demand which could use Istanbul as a transfer airport is also growing rapidly. So I would be very surprised if it was not (barring war, civil unrest, etc.).\"\n\nDr Lynnette Dray, Senior Research Associate, Bartlett School Env, Energy & Resources, Faculty of the Built Environment, University College, London\n\n'It will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East'\n\nThe terminal of the new Istanbul Airport, with a banner featuring Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Burak Kara/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\n\"I think that the primary thought behind the new airport is that it will directly compete with the current hub airports in the Middle East such as in Doha and Dubai. I think it's got a very, very good chance of taking market share off them when it comes to single-stop itineraries that go from Asia to Europe and Europe to Asia. But also I think Istanbul is generally better situated. It can also act as a hub to some parts of Africa and indeed the current airport that's there, Atat\u00fcrk, already does.\n\nSo direct flight is increasingly popular and of course a hub airport would have to compete with long-distance direct flights. So I think that might be an issue. And also the fact that this airport's being relocated about 50 kilometers north of the city or north of the current airport means that, I would suspect, there might be a slightly subdued demand for flights to and from Istanbul itself. And also there might be competition from the other airport in Istanbul, Sabiha Gokcen, which is going to end up being slightly closer to the population centers.\n\nI can't see it struggling for passengers, given that the current airport that it's replacing has something like 63 million a year and I'd imagine most of those will transfer to the new airport. So that's already a substantial number of passengers that it's kind of inheriting off the back of the reputation of the previous airport. I would imagine that -- should they operationally run smoothly, so in other words should they have low connecting time, should they implement decent transport connections to the center of Istanbul -- then I can't see why they couldn't hit some of their targets pretty quickly.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/istanbul-new-airport-turkey/index.html", "published": "2018-10-31T01:02:34+00:00"}, {"title": "EasyJet plans electric planes by 2030", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 Passengers concerned about the impact of air travel on the environment could soon opt for a cleaner alternative.\n\nEasyJet, the British-based budget airline, has pledged to develop a fleet of electric planes to cover short-haul routes by 2030, which would effectively reduce carbon emissions and noise from its operations.\n\nThe no-frills carrier is in partnership with US-based manufacturer Wright Electric to build battery-propelled jets for flights of less than two hours.\n\nFounded in 2016, Wright Electric already has a two-seater electric plane and plans to begin flying a nine-seater next year.

The name Ateshgah comes from the Persian for \"home of fire\" and the centerpiece of the complex is a cupola-topped altar shrine, built upon a natural gas vent.\n\nA natural, eternal flame burned here on the central altar until 1969, but these days the fire is fed from Baku's main gas supply and is only lit for visitors.\n\nThe temple is associated with Zoroastrianism but it's as a Hindu place of worship that its history is better documented.\n\nMerchants and ascetics\n\nBuilt like a caravanserai-style travelers' inn, the complex has a walled courtyard surrounded by 24 cells and rooms.\n\nThese were variously used by pilgrims, passing merchants (whose donations were a vital source of income) and resident ascetics, some of whom submitted themselves to ordeals such as lying on caustic quicklime, wearing heavy chains, or keeping an arm in one position for years on end.\n\nThe temple fell out of use as a place of worship in the late 19th century, at a time when the development of the surrounding oil fields meant that veneration of Mammon was gaining a stronger hold.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/yanar-dag-azerbaijan-land-of-fire/index.html", "published": "2018-10-31T11:07:24+00:00"}, {"title": "Hammams in Azerbaijan: Tips for taking a public bath", "text": "Editor's Note \u2014 Editor's Note \u2014 CNN Travel's series often carry sponsorship originating from the countries and regions we profile. However, CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports. Read the policy.\n\n(CNN) \u2014 A place for cleansing and contemplation, for relaxation and conversation.\n\nAzerbaijan 's old hammam culture may have waned in recent years, but many of the city's older residents recall with nostalgia the weekly ritual of visiting the city's public baths.\n\nIn the days of the shahs, the khans and even the Russian Empire, hammams in Azerbaijan were about much more than just getting clean.\n\n\"People got together, chatted, discussed. It was a social institution where you would relax and, everything that had built up inside of you, you'd talk about it and share it,\" says Kamil Ibragimov, head of the archaeological department in Baku's Old City administration.\n\nSpiritual and physical needs\n\nAzerbaijani cities in the Middle Ages were separated into small neighborhoods known as mehelle and each one had its own hammam and mosque, catering to both the spiritual and physical needs of local Muslims.\n\nThe hammam also played a key role in marriage. Long before the Soviets did away with religious conservatism, women's hammams were a natural hunting ground for mothers eager to get a closer look at potential young brides. Men on the other hand used the hammam to strike deals over tea and games of nard, the local version of backgammon.\n\nAzerbaijan's hammams are strictly single sex. Tom Marsden\n\nAbove all, though, hammams were historically a means of maintaining public hygiene.\n\nIn the days of the Silk Road, for example, a hammam stood at both entrances to Baku's Old City and travelers could only enter after burning their old clothes and having a good scrub.\n\nHammam culture dipped a little in Soviet times as apartments were increasingly fitted with their own baths and showers, but hammams were still the first port of call whenever there was a water crisis.\n\nToday there's still a loyal crowd of locals that can't live without a hammam, but before joining them here's a brief guide to its rules and rituals.\n\nHow to hammam\n\n1. Male or female: Hamams in Azerbaijan are strictly segregated: Some are just for men, some for women and some for both but on different days. While this segregation rule has relaxed a little since the Middle Ages -- some male hammams now employ masseuses -- mixed bathing is still a complete no-no.\n\n2. Wear a towel: As opposed to Russian \"banyas\" and Finnish saunas and despite the segregation rule, strutting around completely naked is not allowed. Instead a special towel called a fite must be worn at all times.\n\n3. Be whipped: Given the former Russian influence over the Caucasus it's no surprise that bushy and aromatic birch twigs have also found their way into the Azerbaijani hammam.\n\nBeing lightly whipped by a companion in the parkhana, or steam room, stirs up the heat and aids breathing and circulation.\n\nRelated content The mud volcano capital of the world\n\n4. Scrub hard: Central to the Azerbaijani hamam ritual is kise, in which a person called a kisechi scrubs all the grime from your body using a large abrasive glove. It may feel a little forceful at first, but will leave a light tingle across the body.\n\n5. Steam room etiquette: A felt hat should also be worn to insulate you (and your hair) and prevent overheating. Scrubbing in the steam room is strictly prohibited.\n\n6. Foamy soap: Another interesting ritual is something called kurpuk. Soap and water are whisked together with a special net to create big clouds of soapy foam which the kisechi rubs over every inch of your body.\n\n7. Coffee, salt and honey: Another procedure is rubbing salt, coffee and honey into the skin. The salt helps you sweat, the coffee is aromatic and the honey soothes any wounds and inflammations.\n\n8. Take your time: The bathing process itself shouldn't be rushed, but equally important is drinking tea afterward. There's no time limit on how long you can spend at the hammam so it's not unusual to sit, scrub and socialize over six to eight hours.\n\n9. Admire the architecture: Azerbaijan's old hammams were built in the Eastern style common across Iran, Central Asia and the Middle East. A key feature is the cupola with holes at the top, superbly engineered to let air out but not let rainwater in. Older hammams were often built half-underground, keeping them warm in winter and cool in summer.\n\nMost of Azerbaijan's old hammams stopped functioning a long time ago. Some are preserved as monuments while others have been converted into shops, bazaars or tea houses. But there are still a few places in central Baku to experience the steamy rituals of the past.\n\nAgha Mikayil Hamami\n\nMen and women are both welcome at Baku's oldest hammam. Tom Marsden\n\nThis is the number one choice for a quintessential Azerbaijani hammam experience. Built in the 18th century, Agha Mikayil is Baku's oldest functioning hammam. It operates separate days for men and women and is run by an enthusiastic team with lots of experience.\n\n\"I'm like an amphibian,\" longtime manager Orkhan Gasimov tells CNN Travel . \"I can't live without a hamam.\"\n\nGiven its timeless appeal, Agha Mikayil has been used several times as a film location. A hammam scene from the 1956 film \"If Not This One, Then That One\" is especially popular.\n\nWomen's days are Mondays and Fridays, all the rest are for men. Basic entrance is just 10 manats (around $6), including limitless access to the steam room, showers and pool. Extra services cost as follows: body scrub -- 10 manats; coffee, salt and honey treatment -- 20 manats; massage -- 20 manats.\n\nAgha Mikayil Hamami, 16, Kickik Qala, Icheri Sheher, Baku; +994-50-345-21-44\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami caters to a local crowd. Tom Marsden\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami (also known as Prestige) dates back to Baku's late 19th-century oil boom. This was originally a men's hammam, switched to being women-only during the Soviet era, and is now once again exclusively for men.\n\nToday this hammam has a local clientele, offers all the traditional treatments and still breathes the spirit of the past.\n\nPrices: entrance (including steam room and baths) -- 12 manats; 30-minute massage -- 15 manats; the full package costs about 60 manats ($35).\n\nAgha Zeynal Hamami, 5 Saftar Quliyev Street, Icheri Sheher, Baku; +994-55-639-19-99 // +994-55-434-65-35\n\nShe-Bi Hamami\n\nElegant detailing at She-Bi Hamami. Tom Marsden\n\nThis 19th-century hammam -- known until recently as Gasim Bey Hammam, after its millionaire founder Gasim Bey -- was exclusively for women for most of its existence.\n\nIt's now a men-only hammam and is especially popular with civil servants, thanks to its location near four government ministries.\n\nThe main attractions are its elegant central pool and a locals-only feel. It offers all the usual procedures (steam room, whipping, pool, scrub, mochalka -- a smoothing wash with soap -- and massage), plus there's an in-house barber, caf\u00e9 and a booth for pedicures.\n\nPrices are 12 manats for entrance (includes unlimited time in the steam room and pool); 12 manats for scrubbing, 20 manats for an hour-long massage.\n\nShe-Bi Hamami, 41 Murtuza Mukhtarov Street, Baku; +994-50-540-08-41\n\nAkhund Hammam\n\nThere's no time limit at hammams, so relax as long as you like. Tom Marsden\n\nFurther along Murtuza Mukhtarov Street is a great example of the age-old link between mosques and hammams. Almost opposite the green-domed Haji Sultan Ali mosque is the men-only Akhund Hammam, named in honor of the akhund (cleric) that lobbied for its construction way back in 1887.\n\nPrices: entrance and use of the sauna -- 10 manats; a 30-minute scrub -- 12 manats; and a 30-minute massage -- 14 manats.\n\nAkhund Hammam, 141 Murtuza Mukhtarov Street; +994-12-595-50-59\n\nRelated content Azerbaijan: What to see and do in the Land of Fire\n\nTezebay Hammam\n\nFor Tom Marsden's story about Azerbaijan hammams (CNN Travel sponsorship: Destination Azerbaijan) Tom Marsden\n\nThis hammam's building may date back to 1886, but it's only been functioning as a hammam for the last 20 years. The eclectic mix of souvenirs, stuffed animals and dim lighting create a wacky ambiance and make the place feel part hammam, part museum. Look out for the portraits of Lenin and Stalin and the small statue of Donald Trump.\n\nWhile less historic, its services and equipment are a little more upmarket. This is reflected in the prices - 23 manats covers entrance while the average all-inclusive package is 86 manats. This includes Russian, Turkish and Finnish saunas, pool and baths, body scrub, a half-hour massage and veniki (birch-twig whipping).\n\nTezebay is especially popular with stag and hen parties.

But it's Azerbaijan , the mud volcano capital of the world.\n\nOil-rich region\n\nThere are more than 400 volcanoes in this oil-rich country balanced between Europe and Asia, with more being discovered all the time.\n\nTen years ago, a 12,000-hectare State Nature Reserve was founded on the Absheron Peninsula near the capital Baku.\n\nIn July 2018, scientists from Azerbaijan's Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources took CNN Travel on an off-road tour.\n\nClattering up the precipitous slopes in an off-road vehicle is like a firmer version of the dune-bashing safaris popular next door in the Middle East. But the most thrilling sights are still to come.\n\nWe start our tour beside the mouth of Deveboynu volcano, or \"Neck of the Camel.\" The land around is parched, but inside the crater, a muddy slurry -- called mud breccia -- is bubbling gently.\n\nThe hills may look peaceful, but below this humped, reptilian landscape, the Earth is breathing and turning like a slumbering beast.\n\nRelated content Azerbaijan: What to see and do in the Land of Fire\n\nl e v a r t\n\nWhere tectonic plates collide\n\nMud volcanoes are usually found in subduction zones -- the parts of the globe where tectonic plates collide, sometimes causing earthquakes, tsunamis and violent eruptions.\n\nPockets of subterranean gas force their way to the surface, belching out methane and a muddy mix of water and oil.\n\nMud volcanoes never grow to the size of regular volcanoes. Most are small, ever-changing landforms, often accompanied by peculiar sculptures formed by the spewed out clumps of clay.\n\nThese whimsical shapes, says Jeyhun Pashayev, director of the reserve, are \"like a picture made by a child.\"\n\nStrange beauty\n\n\"When there are mud volcanoes, it means there are carbohydrogen resources in the deep,\" explains Pashayev. \"As you see, there are lot of mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan which means there are a lot of oil resources.\"\n\nThe arid lands of the Absheron Peninsula might not be as fresh and lush as the mountainous north, but they have their own strange beauty.\n\nThis is the region richest in natural resources: both for oil and for the mud breccia, which is used in the chemical and construction industries.\n\n\"About 20 of the 50 minerals used in cement\" are to be found in the volcanic mud, says Pashayev -- which meant that before the reserve was signed into existence, people regularly stole mud from the site for home building projects.\n\nAs we set out on the road again to our next volcanic field, Pashayev gestures towards a huge factory on the horizon, with a large hill of mud to its side. \"This, Garadagh, is the richest part of Baku. Around 90% of the stones are being produced here for building the houses. Depending on the quality, it costs from 50 cents to 3 manats ($1.77) per stone.\"\n\nPashayev and his team hand-make signs to warn off trespassers on the reserve. Maureen O'Hare/CNN\n\nMud-bathing\n\nUnlike regular volcanoes, there's no magma or lava, so the liquid mud isn't hot -- instead it usually keeps to a temperate 22/23 C (72 F).\n\nThat balminess means that some mud volcanoes are suitable for bathing.\n\nVolcanic clay is sometimes used in the treatment of skin conditions, as well as rheumatism and diseases related to the nervous system.\n\nPashayev explains that during the Soviet era, the volcanic mud was sometimes used to create casts to treat broken bones.\n\n\"Also, you can get super results using the mud volcanoes for the skin,\" he claims. \"You can use [the mud] and get good results, even if you have scars. If the cosmetology doctor can't disappear the scars, mud volcanoes can do this!\"\n\nRadioactivity\n\nHowever, not every gray puddle is skin-friendly.\n\n\"Because it comes from deep,\" says Pashayev, some volcanoes \"come with radioactive material. It's not a joke.\"\n\nPashayev's team monitors the levels of radioactivity regularly, with safety certification being awarded on an annual basis.\n\nThe subterranean world has fascinated people around the globe for millennia, and the strange, violent and seemingly inexplicable behavior of mud volcanoes has long captivated the Azerbaijani people.\n\nThe country is known as the Land of Fire -- while Baku is the City of Winds -- and some of the gas leaks in this oil-rich region are constantly on fire, such as at the perpetually burning mountainside of Yanar Dag.\n\nIt's believed that the ancient Zoroastrian religion, which centers on fire worship, was closely connected to this phenomena.\n\nIn 2001, Lokbutan volcano some 15 kilometers from Baku erupted, sending flames close to 50 feet in the air.\n\nRelated content Naftalan: The Azerbaijan resort where guests bathe in crude oil\n\n'A mystic thing'\n\nThe ever-bubbling cauldron of Pilpili Gardag. Maureen O'Hare/CNN\n\n\"Mud volcanoes are a mystic thing,\" says Pashayev. Some years ago, a Danish sound archivist came to the reserve \"with a huge device like a piano\" to record the sounds from within the volcano.\n\nWhat Pashayev heard shocked him. \"I swear, I thought that this is Hell. I heard human noises -- really. Imagine thousands of people, crying 'help us!' from the deep.\"\n\nWith a similarly evocative turn of phrase, Pashayev also compares the wind sighing through a mud sculpture to the sound made \"when you cut the head off a cow\" -- a common sight on the backstreets of Baku until butchery regulations were changed earlier this year.\n\nAnd if the Azerbaijani landscape seems otherworldly, that could be because conditions here aren't dissimilar to Mars.\n\nA number of possible mud volcanoes have been found on Mars , suggesting the presence -- at one time -- of water, and therefore the possibility of life.\n\n'Millions of snakes'\n\n\"There are six types of mud volcano,\" explains Pashayev. \"Active. Not active. Oil-producing. Underwater. Island mud volcano. And destroyed mud volcano.\"\n\nThere are around 140 underwater mud volcanoes in Azerbaijan and there are six island volcanoes under the reserve's jurisdiction -- although explains scientist Anar Baghiriv, the team lacks the resources to visit them.\n\nBut on one of the island volcanoes, Pashayev explains, the strangest sight isn't the bubbling mud. \"From 100 meters, you see that the island is shaking. But when you go close, you see millions of snakes, can you imagine? Millions.\"\n\nSo covered is the island with sea snakes, adds Baghiriv, \"You cannot find a place to put your foot.\"\n\nWhat lies beneath\n\nPilpili Gardag is the last stop on our tour. Once we're ushered past the security guard, it's a steep walk uphill to the most dramatic volcano yet.\n\nThe slick surface of the mud glistens in the searing July sunshine, with huge gray bubbles forming and then bursting with a satisfying plup.\n\nMud volcano eruptions vary enormously, from those that quietly, continuously pour out slow streams of slurry, to explosive eruptions that expel thousands of cubic meters at once.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, says Pashayev, we have \"different sizes, different views, different sculptures. We have all the types, all the forms.\"\n\nThe Guinness Book of Records lists the world's largest mud volcano as being an Azerbaijani one, measuring one kilometer across the base and several hundred kilometers in height.\n\nAt Pilipili Gardag, the volatile lunar landscape, with the sun bouncing white off the bleached-out clay and the summer heat sliding towards 40 C (104 F), has an uncanny majesty.\n\nBut the real mysteries, the churning, living wonders, are in the many shifting layers beneath our feet.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/azerbaijan-mud-volcanoes/index.html", "published": "2018-08-30T12:19:44+00:00"}, {"title": "Master jeweler invents 'unbreakable' porcelain", "text": "Written by Stephy Chung, CNN Hong Kong Contributors Momo Moussa, Tom Booth, CNN\n\nIn Pursuit of Rare is a new series telling the stories of the master makers who deal in the most precious things on earth.\n\nEvery day Wallace Chan \"communicates\" with the universe, turning rough, ancient gemstones into extraordinary pieces of jewelry.\n\n\"I learn from the color, the shape, the light,\" Chan says, rotating a block of tourmaline in his hand. \"When you cut, when you polish, it's like music.

Covering our bodies in clothes or adornments is an almost universal behavior, and how you dress is one of the most obvious indicators of who you are.\n\nShow me a list of people, and the fashion brands they buy from or engage with, and I could easily produce a series of assumptions about each one. I might make an educated guess about their spending power, or how fashion-conscious they are (or aren't). I might even be able to give you a sense of their character -- at least, I'd feel fairly confident distinguishing the peacocks from the shrinking violets.\n\nSpeaking at The Business of Fashion's Voices conference in the UK on Thursday, data analyst and Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie took this relatively simple idea to its worrying but logical extension: Like any tool, he said, fashion can become a weapon in the wrong hands.\n\n\"Fashion data was used to build AI models to help Steve Bannon build his insurgency and build the alt-right,\" he told the conference. \"We used weaponized algorithms. We used weaponized cultural narratives to undermine people and undermine the perception of reality. And fashion played a big part in that.\"\n\nHe would certainly know. As research director at Cambridge Analytica, Wylie used data harvested from 87 million Facebook users to produce algorithms that he says influenced the 2016 US presidential election. And having previously worked toward a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he knew that someone's choice of clothing is one of the best ways to unpick their identity.\n\nOn stage, Wylie explained how people's preferences for fashion brands on social media were used to target specific groups with right-wing political messages. Although he has previously divulged how people's online activity was used to predict political leanings, it was the first time that he publicly detailed fashion's role -- and importance -- in Cambridge Analytica's models.\n\nDuring his presentation, Wylie showed various charts and graphics demonstrating how the now-defunct firm mapped clothing brands against personality traits.\n\n\"There are strong relationships between the brands, style and aesthetics that people engage with, and how they see themselves and their identity,\" Wylie said during the talk.\n\nChristopher Wylie speaks on stage during The Business of Fashion's Voices conference in Oxfordshire, England. The chart compares supposed personality traits of individuals who like Wrangler versus Abercrombie & Fitch. Credit: John Phillips/Getty Images for The Business of Fashion\n\nBrands like Wrangler, the jeans company, and the American student favorite Abercrombie & Fitch were compared and contrasted. Wrangler is \"more cowboy, older,\" and more \"modest\" than Abercrombie, Wylie said. People who like yoga-wear brand Lululemon \"are more extroverted,\" while L.L. Bean fans are conscientious but \"low in openness.\" Other brands featured included Nike, Louis Vuitton, Burberry, Armani, H&M, Elle and Vogue.\n\nThe simple, palatable takeaway is that modest, traditional, conventional brands tend to be favored by those with more conservative ideals, while provocative, directional brands, like Kenzo, were more likely to be worn by the liberal-minded.\n\nA model walks in Kenzo, during the men's Spring/Summer 2019 collection fashion show on June 24, 2018 in Paris. Credit: FRANCOIS GUILLOT/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTargeting vulnerability\n\nThe idea that advertisers might target us based on the brands we like, follow, talk about or engage with is hardly new. Nor is the story that Cambridge Analytica used \"hyper-profiling\" to target different groups for political gain.\n\nMore interesting, however, is Wylie's claim that fashion preferences are statistically among the strongest indicators of our personalities -- and that they were a particular focus at Cambridge Analytica.\n\nWhat makes this especially irksome is the emphasis on specific personality traits. Openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (the \"big five\" identified in a psychological model known as OCEAN) were the key traits mentioned.\n\nBut others listed in the materials shared by Wylie included depression, anger and vulnerability. In other words, people were being segmented on the basis of their mental stability. Then, if they were considered vulnerable to persuasion, they were targeted with political messaging. This is where the story starts to take on dystopian overtones.\n\nAccording to Wylie, and as reported by The Business of Fashion, \"consulting psychologists encouraged researchers at the firm to ask more questions on aesthetic and stylistic preferences for clothing as they were found to be strong signifiers of traits that were used as a primary means to identify people who were susceptible to joining the alt-right.\"\n\nA placard of Abercrombie & Fitch hangs at the opening of a flagship store on October 25, 2012 in Munich, Germany.

Those in the room had \"created the battlefields\" of a culture war, he said before directly challenging them to fix the problem.\n\n\"We need you guys to do a better job at cultivating our cultural narratives, for our own national security and for the preservation of our democracy,\" he said.\n\n\"The shame, the colonialism, the racial biases, the toxic masculinity, the fat-shaming that industry puts out -- and has been putting out for decades -- is exactly what Cambridge Analytica sought to exploit when they were seeking to undermine people and manipulate them.\"\n\nThe message, in simple terms: Stop making people feel bad, Fashion. It makes them easy targets for untoward digital dealings.\n\nA call to arms\n\nIt was difficult to get a sense of how the CEOs and other fashion industry figures in the room felt about Wylie's rallying cry. There was loud clapping, and most people stood to cheer eventually, but the room didn't exactly shake. Just hours later, designer Alber Elbaz attracted a more kinetic reaction by ending his own talk by blasting out Aretha Franklin's \"Respect\" and dragging people up on stage for a dance.\n\nDid Wylie tell the industry something it already knew? Or is this another case of negative news overload -- just another horrible story about the US presidential election and data?\n\nThere are, of course, fashion brands that understand how to balance looking good and doing good. Some of them were represented at the conference.\n\nStella McCartney, for instance, has been working towards sustainability in fashion for nearly 20 years, and she used the event to announce two new green initiatives: A United Nations charter for sustainable fashion, launching officially on December 10 at the UN's annual climate change conference, and Stella McCartney Cares Green, a new arm of her charity platform.\n\nChristopher Wylie speaks on stage during Voices.

The fashion world is already tackling a number of troubling issues right now: diversity and inclusion, the treatment of models, human rights in garment factories, sustainability, the fur question. Solving some of these would, indirectly, constitute a start, as it would help craft more positive narratives for brands in need, but the road looks long.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/christopher-wylie-fashion-cambridge-analytica/index.html", "published": "2018-11-30T11:17:28+00:00"}, {"title": "Photographer Florian Joahn on male identity", "text": "Written by Jessica Lack, CNN\n\nThis story forms part of a collaboration with Dazed Beauty -- a new platform dedicated to redefining the language and communication of beauty.\n\nEarlier this year, fashion photographer Florian Joahn had a creative crisis. \"There are so many images out there,\" he said, \"why would I add to that? I am a white male, tall, my narrative just isn't that interesting.\"\n\nHe has a point; with nearly 50,000 pictures uploaded every minute on Instagram , it is not easy to be seen in the digital morass. Joahn's solution was to question his reasons for becoming a photographer. It coincided with a trip to S\u00e3o Paulo to document a transgender community for an exhibition called \"Y'all better quiet down\" (inspired by trans rights activist Sylvia Rivera) with his collaborator, stylist Jean Paul Paula. \"I realized that I was giving this group a platform they otherwise wouldn't have. That is important, not another picture of a pretty girl in a dress.\"\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nChallenging fashion conventions\n\nA quick look at the London-based photographer's Instagram feed will tell you there have been few pretty girls in dresses since then. What it does reveal is a fashion photographer with a singular language and a sinewy intellect for challenging stereotypical visions of male identity. \"I always start out by asking why would I make this image?\" he said. \"I need to have a reason.\"\n\nRelated video: Why nightclubs are better than art galleries\n\nDo commercial demands of fashion photography constrain his freedom? \"Strangely enough, no, fashion is very open, much more so than documentary.\" He cites the uncompromising Peter Lindbergh as a good example of a photographer who has successfully navigated the market forces of the fashion world. \"He redefined how women should look, his images are raw, no make-up, I didn't even know that was fashion photography when I first saw his pictures,\" he said.\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula. Credit: Florian Joahn\n\nJoahn is engagingly eloquent and refreshingly candid about the paradoxes of the fashion world. Born in 1990 in the stark industrial environs of East Germany, just as socialism was collapsing, Joahn knew he wanted to be in fashion from the age of five. \"I loved the beauty and the fantasy of it. Growing up as a gay boy in a very conservative town, I just didn't fit in.\" His introduction to photography was via the unorthodox route of producing fake IDs for his friends. \"I realized I could manipulate their faces in Photoshop and enhance their features. It made me realize a photograph is more than just representation, you can create with it.\"\n\nBroader visions of male identity\n\nAt 18, desperate to escape his sheltered upbringing, he moved to Ghana to teach. There, Joahn discovered the African narrative he had been led to believe in was nothing like reality.\n\nRelated video: Exploring Japan's 'genderless' subculture\n\n\"I came as a volunteer, but I wasn't smart or aware, how was I going to help a 40-year-old man with his own business? There is this weird white idea about Africa being an underdeveloped place, but it's just a different way of living. I lost a lot of my judgement.\"\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula.

Did he not want to study fashion? \"I had this bourgeois mind-set that fashion wasn't deep enough. It was only when I got accepted onto a master's program at the St\u00e4delschule in Frankfurt that I realized my heart wasn't in it.\" However, his training in the visual arts gave him the courage to push aesthetic boundaries while also retaining a strong social message. \"Sure, I'm not afraid of creating tension,\" he said.\n\nPhotograph by Florian Joahn, in collaboration with JeanPaul Paula.

The Italian director's latest project, a remake of the cult classic from horror master Dario Argento, takes us to a dance school in frosty post-war Berlin; one that lures young women into the grasp of a cunning coven of witches who condemn their victims to hell. Much like the original, it's a stylish and dramatic horror movie about the brutal sacrifice of purity and innocence.\n\nHis audacity attracted one of the most stunning, almost entirely women-based ensemble casts of the year. Dakota Johnson and Academy Award-winner Tilda Swinton -- two actors he worked with for his 2015 drama \"A Bigger Splash\" -- occupy the two central roles as student Susie Bannon and formidable dance teacher Madame Blanc respectively.\n\nIt seems a surprising choice of subject matter for Guadagnino to tackle just a year after the release of his Oscar-winning love story \"Call Me by Your Name,\" which propelled him to international fame. While that might have been a relative crowd-pleaser, \"Suspiria\" sets out to divide its audience by throwing blood, saliva and guts against the wall.\n\nGiulia Piersanti, a costume designer and freelance knitwear designer for brands like Celine and Balenciaga, followed Guadagnino from the sun loungers of Northern Italy into the fiery pits of hell for \"Suspiria.\" In an email interview, she broke down how she dressed the coven at the heart of the film.\n\n\"Suspiria\" stars Mia Goth, as well as Dakota Fanning, Tilda Swinton and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz among others. Credit: Amazon Studios\n\nCNN: You've said you like working on the costume creation for film because it gives you the ability to create a world from A to Z. In the case of \"Suspiria,\" what was point A?\n\nGiulia Piersanti: I meant that in my work as a fashion designer, I work mainly on knitwear. On the other hand, costume design lets me create every aspect of a wardrobe.\n\nIn many ways, the fashion of the film is key to the creation of its eerie and foreboding atmosphere. How did symbolism play into the garments you created for characters?\n\nI started to research witchcraft and symbolisms, I found myself more interested elsewhere, in the works by artists I admire like Louise Bourgeois and Rebecca Horn, who used the woman's body as a tool. With humor and irony, I used the archetypes of the female body in a series of graphic prints I had printed on different blouses and dresses; used real human hair to make the sabbath's ceremonial costumes; and (used) bondage ropes for the Volk dance (the dancers' debut performance).\n\n'Phantom Thread': Lesley Manville's dress fitting for the Oscars\n\nWith period films, there's a tendency to work with tropes or trends of that era to create a sense of familiarity. Do you feel it's important to dive much deeper than these simple concepts?\n\nWhen making a period piece, I find safety in being just enough \"era-accurate,\" but I stay away from the disillusion of showing stereotypes and trends, especially for the character's in some of Luca's films we worked on.\n\nThe dance students' simple, functional apparel hides their more sinister sides. Credit: Sandro Kopp/Amazon Studios\n\nFrom a social point of view, trends are followed (as much) by higher classes, as it is not chic, and intellectuals opt for individuality of expression. Coming from a background as a fashion designer, it's easy for me to reinterpret an era and to balance what is still common in our wardrobes today from the language of that specific period; to give just the right amount of \"era\" to let the viewer know where in time we are without overdoing it and distracting them ... This gives the chance to concentrate on other aspects of costumes that interest me (and the viewer) more, such as the narrative of these characters.\n\nDakota Johnson as Susie and Mia Goth as Sara. Credit: Sandro Kopp/Amazon Studios\n\nMany of the costumes you created for the film were actual costumes for dancers, rather than everyday garments for characters. How do those processes differ?\n\nCostumes in dance answer to movement and rhythm and this opens new perspectives to how you look at them. The red knotted-rope costumes, and the effect of dripping blood created by the weight of the dangling ropes, gives a sense of anxiety and dread in anticipation of the terror that is to come later.\n\nTilda Swinton as Madam Blanc. Credit: Alessio Bolzoni/Amazon Studios\n\nWhich of the film's characters was the most gratifying for you to design for?\n\nAll of them of course!

The Italian designer has denied writing the messages.\n\nAmid accusations of racism, and boycotts from models and celebrities, the fashion house postponed its Shanghai event Wednesday night -- just hours before it was due to start.\n\nThe controversy began with a series of promotional videos, released by the luxury brand on social media, that feature an Asian model struggling to eat Italian food with chopsticks. Screen captures appear to show a series of direct messages on Instagram in which Gabbana complains about criticisms of the videos. The Italian designer is then accused of making derogatory remarks directed toward China and Chinese people as he defends the ads.\n\nBoth Gabbana and the luxury brand have since posted messages saying that their Instagram accounts had been hacked. On his personal account, Gabbana pasted the words \"not me\" over images of the alleged comments.\n\nThe videos in question first aired on D&G's Instagram, Facebook and Twitter profiles, as well as its Weibo account in China . The three 40-second spots were created to promote \"The Great Show,\" which was billed by the fashion house as a \"tribute to China.\" An earlier WeChat post shared by the company had said that there would be \"a shining runway, modern style and glamorous superstars.\"\n\nThe first \"episode,\" published Sunday, features a model in a sequined red dress attempting to eat an entire pizza. She prods the pizza with chopsticks to the sound of stereotypical Chinese music, before a narrator offers seemingly patronizing advice such as \"don't attempt to use the chopsticks as knives\" and \"just use your chopsticks like pliers.\"\n\nIn the second and third episodes, the same model attempts to eat a cannoli and a bowl of spaghetti. The narrator seems to mispronounce the brand's name, with some interpreting this as mocking the way Chinese people say \"Dolce & Gabbana.\"\n\nWhat was, perhaps, an innocent attempt to play on Chinese culture infuriated some social media users, and the topic began trending on Weibo. But the social media outcry was exacerbated by the alleged Instagram messages.\n\nA model is seen eating pizza with chopsticks in one of three videos posted on social media by Dolce & Gabbana. Credit: Dolce & Gabbana\n\n\"We are very sorry for any distress caused by these unauthorized posts,\" read a message later posted on Dolce and Gabbana's official Instagram account. \"We have nothing but respect for China and the people of China.\"\n\nThe fashion house then doubled down in an official statement provided to the press. \"Our dream was to bring to Shanghai a tribute event dedicated to China which tells our history and vision,\" it read. \"It was not simply a fashion show, but something that we created especially with love and passion for China and all the people around the world who loves Dolce & Gabbana.\"\n\nBut for many, this explanation was not enough. In an Instagram post tagging both the brand and Gabbana directly, Chinese-French model Estelle Chen, who withdrew from the show, doubted the sincerity of the explanation and called the actions \"disrespectful and racist.\"\n\n\"You don't love China, you love money,\" she wrote. \"China is rich yes but China is rich in its values, its culture and its people and they won't spend a penny on a brand that does not respect that.\"\n\nOther models and staff from the event responded by posting images of their event badges with \"not me\" written in red capital letters.\n\nAn agent of singer Karry Wang, a Dolce & Gabbana \"brand ambassador,\" had confirmed that the star would not be attending the show. The modeling agency China Bentley also announced that 24 of its models were pulling out over the controversy.\n\nAmid widespread criticism of Gabbana's alleged comments, reaction to the videos was more varied. In a post being shared online, an account purporting to be University of California student Coco Qiu, describes the video series as \"extremely racist\" and created with the \"intention to spark public attention, and perhaps rage, for the purpose of advertisement and profits.\" The post describes the move as \"both pitiful and disrespectful.\"\n\nBut some segments of Chinese social media reacted in good humor to the controversy.

Her project, named \" Elles x Paris Photo ,\" is taking visitors to discover the women who have picked up a camera -- likely numbering as many as men, according to Escoulen -- but many galleries have left out of the picture.\n\n\"Persimmon, The unknown\" (2018) by Andrea Torres Balaguer. Credit: Andrea Torres Balaguer, Courtesy in camera galerie\n\nIn a phone interview, Escoulen explained the walk will not take the form of a lecture, rather a journey of discovery: \"It's not an exhibition. it's a provocation,\" she said. \"I don't know exactly why women, little by little, disappeared.\"\n\nThe tour takes visitors through the glass-vaulted halls of the Grand Palais, Paris Photo's central hub on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, and through a cross-section of the city's art institutions. Stops along the way include the main venue's historic sister gallery, the Petit Palais, photographic specialists such as Photo Saint Germain and Jeu de Paume, and the Fondation Cartier, the fashion house's imposing collection. Each will show works by women photographers, who, curators said, deserve to be rediscovered or better known by the public.\n\nThe secret world of Ellen von Unwerth\n\nFollowing a chronological path, the project showcases works from photographic pioneers of the early 20th century, such as Scottish-Canadian Margaret Watkins, one of the first women commercial photographers, and Lucia Moholy, the Czech wife of Bauhaus artist Laszlo Moholy Nagy, whose remarkable architectural and personal photography is often cast in the shadow of her husband's fame. Visitors will move through the radical feminists of the 1960s to 1980s -- including Japanese experimental photographer Kunie Sugiura and Jan Groover, whose still life shots influenced a generation that includes Wolfgang Tillmans -- and on to under-recognized contemporary artists.\n\nThe female pioneers of photography\n\n\"Last VIII\" (2009) by Agn\u00e8s Geoffray. Credit: Courtesy of Galerie Mauber\n\nAll around the world, largely self-motivated female photographers have built their practice, side-by-side with male counterparts, almost since Louis Daguerre created the first commercially viable photographic process in Paris, in 1839, explained Escoulen.\n\n\"Photography was a medium that was very simple and very accessible to anyone who wanted to explore it,\" she said. \"Women photographers were probably many when the medium was created -- then they had to deal with being a professional photographer.\"\n\n\"Before long travel, August 23\" (1972) by Rachel Monosov and Admire Kamudzengerere. Credit: Rachel Monosov and Admire Kamudzengerere, Courtesy Catinca Tabacaru Gallery\n\nEven in the medium's early days (when clunky cameras and volatile film stocks required optical and chemical expertise), practical complexities paled in comparison to the hurdles of social expectation, with the requirement to raise families preventing most female photographers from maintaining careers.\n\nDespite social barriers, many persisted, with Watkins spending the 1920s photographing pioneering advertising images of domestic scenes for Macy's department stores, and later traveling to document the early Soviet Union.\n\nChen Man: 'Tech and art must go together'\n\nWhile most roles as war or documentary photographers were taken by men, Escoulen identifies global similarities among early 20th century female pioneers, who often worked in isolation. Countless photographs depict interests that appear surprisingly contemporary -- intimacy, domesticity, tenderness and self-representation -- all of which would later begin to characterize a generation of 21st century photographic artists.\n\n\"Fish on the Plate\" (1935) by Marta Aczel. Credit: Estate of the artist, courtesy of Vintage Gal\u00e9ria Budapest\n\nEscoulen said male acclaim was self-reinforcing throughout photography's early days, with men in prominent positions in magazines and museums supporting other men to launch exhibitions and validate their work.\n\nMeanwhile, many talented women fell by the wayside, unheralded by institutions or, for myriad reasons, giving up the camera. Despite earning early exhibitions in the US, Watkins skirted the limelight and spent much of her life caring for elderly aunts in Edinburgh. By the time she died in 1969, she was a virtual unknown and it would be decades before her negatives were rediscovered and museums began celebrating her work.\n\nBut, by the 1960s and 1970s, feminist movements across the arts explicitly challenged masculine norms. American photographer Joan Lyons, who will discuss her work at Paris Photo on Nov. 8, produced introspective images of her own experience that fought back prevailing beliefs that photos should be universal and objective. Instead, she used Polaroid, Xerox machines and other alternative methods of image making to create personal images that were inseparable from her experience.\n\n\"Presences 1\" (1980) by Joan Lyons. Credit: Joan Lyons, Courtesy Steven Kasher Gallery\n\nEscoulen said that despite huge changes and tools like Instagram allowing anyone to self-publish photos, there remains worldwide institutional resistance to women succeeding in photography.\n\n\"I would say most of them suffer a lack of visibility,\" she said.\n\nWhile the erasure of female photographers is a global problem, to Escoulen some countries have been slower to tackle galleries' biases and to give a platform to female photographers.\n\nIn Paris, some galleries, such as Jeu de Paume, consciously maintain a gender parity in their exhibition programming. But they are honorable exceptions. Escoulen described one friend, the photographer Lise Sarfati, who left the French capital for the U.S., where, she felt, \"the question of being a woman or man is not there.\"\n\n\"I think the problem is not only in Paris,\" Escoulen said. \"It is in France but also in Spain and probably in Italy. They are also south (European) countries, so maybe still more misogene (sexist) maybe more machiste (chauvinist).\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/paris-photo-elles-frieze/index.html", "published": "2018-11-05T11:49:56+00:00"}, {"title": "Chen Man: 'Our future will be more visual'", "text": "Written by Chen Man\n\nPhotographer and artist Chen Man is CNN Style's guest editor. She has commissioned a series of features on visual language and imagining the future.\n\nThe definition of beauty changes all the time. And sometimes, as society develops, it goes in cycles, like the changing of the four seasons. Not so long ago, Chinese people saw fashion as something that came from the West. Afraid to make \"mistakes,\" they looked to Europe and America to see which standards had been set. As a result, fashion in China looked pale and blurry.\n\nBut now, the Internet, technology and social media have rendered the world flat. Fashion can be accessed from anywhere, with styles from around the world cohabiting and influencing one another. Go to a high-end Beijing department store, for instance, and you'll see shoppers holding Hermes bags and wearing Chanel tops with Uggs -- all while holding a string of Buddhist prayer beads in their hands. Fusion is the future of fashion.\n\nLike her peers, Chen has witnessed enormous change in China, and has sought to document the profound effect those changes have had on her generation, known as balinghou, or those born after the 1980s.

After all, we live in a world where artificial intelligence is so advanced that it can create art free from human input.\n\nChen Man's work is immediately identifiable -- fantastical, aspirational and imaginative, capturing beauty against often surreal backdrops.

But, like a child, when AI has matured enough, it will develop its own language and its own abilities.\n\nWe may bestow AI with creativity, but that doesn't mean it can't be creative in its own right. Artificial thinking and decision-making is rooted in the power and experience of countless human minds, so it's only logical that this will result in better, bigger and more advanced brains than our own.\n\nIt has already created wonderful examples of painting and music. Yet, some critics question whether anything created this way can ever be considered real art. This is because most people have a limited understanding of AI. They see it as unfathomably complex, or the stuff of science fiction. But applying AI to visual art need not be high-tech. Even the simplest of photo processing apps owe their existence to the development of AI, and its applications will only widen in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 22 A veritable A-to-Z list of Asian celebrities and models have posed for Chen Man.

This is why French marine biologist Louis Boutan is widely considered the early pioneer of the genre, as he was the first to plunge into the ocean to take the first underwater portrait, armed with a camera he had invented with the help of his brother Auguste.\n\nUnderwater photography grew from a long line of documentarians, who wanted to record wildlife beneath the waves. But the attraction to underwater images quickly branched out into the world of make-believe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 Bruce Mozert's underwater photography series was initially created as a commercial project for Silver Springs Park in Florida. Although the late photographer began the series as part of the park's marketing campaign, it now showcases a rare and romantic look at society at the time. Credit: \u00a9 Bruce Mozert. Reprinted by permission of Bruce Mozert and the University Press of Florida.\n\nAs early as 1916, director Stuart Paton adapted Jules Verne's \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" into what became an incredibly expensive production that used a system of mirrors to capture underwater scenes. But it was Bruce Mozert , the grandfather of underwater art photography, who first capitalized on the genre. He was an ace at creating seemingly impossible scenarios, such as a smoke-filled barbecue using a can of condensed milk. Florida was the perfect backdrop for Mozert's interpretations of a homely 1950s way of life, and his images soon became an icon of the clear waters of Silver Springs -- and the American dream.\n\nTaking photography to new dimensions\n\nUnderwater photography has since grown further into an art of its own. Contemporary photographers Barbara Cole and Christy Lee Rogers have become two of the most prominent artists in the field, ingeniously using water as an artistic tool to transform reality. They don't simply drag our on-land surroundings into a pool, in the style of Mozert, but rather take advantage of the submarine environment to create a dream-like alternate dimension.\n\n\"Emulsion\" by Barbara Cole Credit: Barbara Cole\n\n\"My goal since I began to exhibit in 1984 was to push the medium -- to paint with a camera, resisting the realism that is normally expected of photography,\" said Cole via email.\n\nCanadian-born Cole, whose work will be on view at Galerie LeRoyer this month, entered the world of photography at the age of 19, as the fashion editor of the Toronto Sun. Her days were spent taking pictures and absorbing as much as she could from staff photographers, among other editing jobs.\n\nCole, who is \"always looking for a way to transform reality,\" started creating her ethereal compositions by using a Polaroid SX-70. \"When that was no longer an option I decided to accomplish an analogous effect by shooting through water. It was a natural progression. I've been swimming almost daily for 40 years and the secrets and beauty of the way a figure appears underwater hadn't eluded me,\" Cole said.\n\n\"Jet Lag Triptych\", Underworld series, by Barbara Cole Credit: Barbara Cole\n\nAlong with Cole, Rogers is changing the way water is used in photography to create images that can easily be mistaken for paintings and that push the boundaries of reality. Unsurprisingly, water has also had a great bearing on Rogers' life. She now lives in Nashville, Tennessee, and has exhibited globally, but prefers to shoot at sundown in Hawaii, where she grew up.\n\n\"Water was like freedom, purity and pure lifeblood. It was also an overwhelming powerful destroyer at the same time. A body immersed in it, free from gravity but trapped by the inability to breathe or survive under it, was a great dichotomy that was profoundly compelling to me,\" Rogers said in an email.\n\nIn these shoots, the main working environment is inhospitable, so the connection between the image maker and the models becomes even more important. Rogers explained she has to be the \"eyes of the models\" because they have to keep them shut as soon as they're submerged.\n\n\"Alive\" by Christy Lee Rogers Credit: Christy Lee Rogers\n\n\"This is how one of my favorite models Elisabeth Donaldson explains her experience, 'when modeling underwater there is an initial moment of complete physical terror. You have blown out all of your air, and are underwater in darkness, searching for light, wrapped in fabric that grabs you and pulls you and covers your face,'\" said Rogers.\n\nShe continued: \"I don't think these images are supposed to be possible. Every time I do a shoot, I think it'll be my last because I don't know if I'll be able to capture it again. It's so exhausting for me mentally and physically.\"\n\n\"Obsession\" by Christy Lee Rogers Credit: Christy Lee Rogers\n\nSince the early 20th century, fine art underwater photography has evolved from Mozert's surrealist, submerged renditions of life on land to Rogers's and Cole's painterly images, reminiscent of Botticelli's billowy fabrics and floating figures.\n\n\"Short of working in outer space it's the best place to be able to play with gravity. Under the water I'm dealing with a weightless world.

It's a project he calls \"Derelict.\"\n\n\"The whole idea of the Derelict series is that we do a lot of work to make it look like we did no work.

It could be everything from a simple online ad through to package delivery service employees that we work with because they're in everyone's garage or even a couple of firemen so they kind of know what's hiding here and there, and then we pay a finder's fee to them we bring the vehicle here.\"\n\nIcon\n\nThis process takes anywhere from 72 hours to two years, and there have even been times where the search had to be abandoned.\n\nTo achieve the results Ward so meticulously desires, his technicians and engineers have to employ some pretty unique processes.

Imagine a rusty, vintage Thriftmaster pickup truck that drives as fast as a sportscar.\n\nIt's a somewhat radical concept in the luxury car industry. \"A lot of people look at the Derelict projects and go, 'Why on earth would anyone spend all that time and money on something that looks, pretty bad?\" So not everyone gets it,\" Ward mused.\n\nIcon\n\nEach year, Icon delivers about 250 vehicles, but the Derelicts are the most rarefied. They only produce around three or four a year so, in total, they have delivered just under two dozen.\n\n\"The business model of building the Derelicts is pretty darn stupid. At the end of the year we're lucky to break even on them,\" he admitted.\n\n\"We are constantly riding the knife's edge on a design and engineering perspective.

The resulting photographs, taken during aerial reconnaissance missions, allowed allied forces to distinguish between foliage and the enemy camouflage it concealed.\n\nNow, more than seven decades on, photographic artist Lynda Laird has used precisely the same technology to retell one of the conflict's defining episodes.\n\nHer images of abandoned bunkers were taken along the Normandy coast, where the D-Day landings took place in June 1944.

But he was also a romantic husband to Barbara, his wife of 22 years, an engaged citizen who befriended several US presidents, and a painter who embraced abstraction.\n\nGlimpses into Ol' Blue Eyes' life -- the public persona and his more private side -- will be on display at Sotheby's upcoming New York sale of the estate of Barbara Sinatra (who passed away last year) in December. Drawn from their residences in Beverly Hills and Malibu, and the house Barbara purchased in Rancho Mirage, California after her husband's death in 1998, the more than 200 lots range from professional memorabilia to personal items that cast a new light on the performer.\n\nFrank Sinatra with his fourth and final wife, Barbara Sinatra. Credit: Courtesy the Estate of Barbara Sinatra\n\n\"People think of Sinatra as an entertainer, a singer and actor, somebody who liked to have a lot of fun with his friends, and a drinker, but ultimately what this sale illustrates is that he was very politically engaged and intellectual,\" Mari-Claudia Jimenez, managing director of Sotheby's Fiduciary Client Group, said in a phone interview.\n\nThe last large major Sinatra auction was held by Christie's in 1995, when Frank and Barbara organized what they jokingly called a \"garage sale\" after they sold their Rancho Mirage home. That auction of 250 lots raised $2.07 million, far above the presale estimate of $1.5 million.\n\nThis December's auction has an overall estimate of $3.5 million, though Sotheby's is hoping the Sinatra mystique will pull in far more.\n\nThe singer and the showgirl\n\nBarbara, a former model and Las Vegas showgirl, was Frank's fourth and last wife. In her memoir, \"Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank,\" she recalled how her \"romantic husband went out of his way\" to make her feel \"loved and cherished every day, taking the time to express his feelings,\" leaving little notes and cards for her to find.\n\nThe couple first met as neighbors in the early 1960s, 10 years before he finally kissed her at a party thrown by Eva Gabor. They were married in 1976.\n\nHow do art auctions really work?\n\nFrank's proposal was convoluted. First, he threw two huge jewels onto the bed (including an emerald-cut 20-carat diamond) and told her to pick one. Then, after having the chosen stone set, he dropped it into a glass of champagne for her to discover.\n\nThe 20.60-carat engagement ring carries an upper estimate of $1.5 million and is the top piece of jewelry in the sale, though there are several other pieces of note, including classic designs by Van Cleef & Arpels, Bulgari, David Webb and Marina B -- one of Barbara's favorite designers.\n\nIn her memoir, \"Lady Blue Eyes: My Life with Frank,\" Barbara Sinatra described how her husband went out of his way to make her feel \"loved and cherished every day, taking the time to express his feelings.\" Credit: Courtesy the Estate of Barbara Sinatra\n\n\"He loved buying jewels for her and spontaneously surprising her in interesting ways,\" Jimenez said. \"There was a time when he'd put bracelets and rings in her pockets for her to find. One time, they were watching television, eating popcorn and she found a diamond ring inside the popcorn box.\"\n\nAll the presidents' friend\n\nFrank Sinatra and John F.

Kennedy as a young senator, Frank had actively campaigned for Kennedy's presidential bid in 1960 and helped plan his inaugural gala. The auction includes a dedicated copy of Kennedy's 1955 book \"Profiles in Courage,\" signed when he was still a senator, as well as a deluxe edition of the inaugural gala program and three volumes of Kennedy's public papers, containing messages, speeches and statements he made as president.\n\n\"The intellectual aspect of his relationship with various presidents is important. It wasn't just about being the entertainment director. I think he felt like politics was part of his civic duties and part of being a good American citizen,\" Jimenez said.\n\nThe auction also includes signed books by or photographs of Harry Truman, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, George Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\nFrank Sinatra with President Ronald Reagan, a personal friend who he tirelessly supported.

Nancy Reagan can be seen in the background of a photograph taken of the Sinatras as they cut their wedding cake.\n\nCome paint with me\n\nWhile the 1995 featured several impressionist paintings and works by American artists, the upcoming Sotheby's auction includes a few fine art paintings that the couple had kept. On offer are a 1973 Norman Rockwell portrait of Sinatra he had commissioned and posed for, and a 1938 Walt Kuhn oil on canvas, \"Girl With Turban (Zuleika),\" which took pride of place in the couple's living room and reminded Barbara of her days as a show girl.\n\n\"Girl With Turban\" (1938) by Walt Kuhn once hung in Barbara and Frank Sinatra's living room.

The most well-known was a work that belonged to Ronald Reagan and was sold in 2016 for $223,500.\"\n\nJimenez notes that while Frank was more interested in collecting figurative works, as a painter he focused on abstract art, creating work in the style of artists he admired, like Piet Mondrian, Robert Motherwell and Kazimir Malevich.\n\n\"There is in the sale a couple of clown paintings that are meant to be more allegorical about how he felt as an entertainer wearing a mask on stage, but that is the only time really when he's done something more figurative,\" Jimenez said.\n\nThe estate sale will be offered over three separate events: Lady Blue Eyes: Property of Barbara and Frank Sinatra, Lady Blue Eyes: Online, and finally as part of the Magnificent Jewels sale.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/barbara-frank-sinatra-sothebys-auction/index.html", "published": "2018-11-12T14:17:29+00:00"}, {"title": "A cultural history of the color pink", "text": "Written by Marianna Cerini, CNN\n\nElvis Presley's iconic 1955 Cadillac, Marilyn Monroe in a figure-hugging dress in \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and the sea of \"pussyhats\" that swarmed the Women's March in Washington DC earlier this year.\n\nThese iconic images all share a common thread: the color pink.\n\nThroughout the centuries, pink has assumed a range of guises, from Barbie's dresses to the saris of the Indian vigilante group, the Gulabi Gang. The way it is perceived by society has also changed over the years, at various times being considered feminine, erotic, kitsch, sophisticated and transgressive.\n\n\"Pink has always been a color in transition, and so have social attitudes towards it,\" said Valerie Steele, editor of the recently published book \"Pink: The History of a Punk, Pretty, Powerful Color,\" in a phone interview.\n\nModels wearing so-called \"pussyhats,\" a symbol of women's rights, at Milan Fashion Week in 2017. Credit: MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\"Even during the last two years, as I started looking at the history of colors, people have taken new stances towards it. We've seen the rise of millennial pink as a 'It' hue, but also its appropriation by feminists around the world as a powerful, socio-political mark.\n\n\"The 150-year-old notion of pink as synonym with fragile femininity brought forward by the West is being challenged. Pink is now having a 'cool' phase: It's hip, it's androgynous, it's strong. And it's here to stay.\"\n\nA colorful history\n\nIn the West, pink first became fashionable in the mid-1700s, when European aristocrats -- both men and women -- wore faint, powdery variants as a symbol of luxury and class. Madame de Pompadour, the chief mistress of Louis XV, loved the color so much that, in 1757, French porcelain manufacturer S\u00e8vres named its exquisite new shade of pink, Rose Pompadour, after her.\n\nPink was not then considered a \"girls\" color -- infants of both sexes were dressed in white. The tint was, in fact, often considered more appropriate for little boys because it was seen as a paler shade or red, which had \"masculine,\" military undertones.\n\nA 1779 image of a man dressed in pink, by Pierre-Thomas LeClerc. Credit: Valerie Steele\n\nThe more recent association with women and femininity started around the mid-19th century when, according to Steele, \"men in the Western world increasingly wore dark, sober colors,\" leaving brighter and pastel options to their female counterparts.\n\n\"The feminization of pink really began around there,\" she explained. \"Pink became an expression of delicacy, as well as froth.\"\n\nPink also, as Steele's book notes, developed its first erotic connotations around this time, because it hinted at nakedness. Lingerie in shades of pink became increasingly common, as did references to the color's sexual allure in literature and art -- always in relation to the female body.\n\nBy the turn of century, pink had entered the mainstream -- and its status shifted in the process. The advent of industrialization and mass-production led to the growing cheap dyes like magenta, which resulted in bright, garish versions of the color. Pink went from luxury to working-class and, as a color often worn by prostitutes at the time, from sophisticated to vulgar.\n\nA pink corset dating back to 1880s America. Credit: The Museum at FIT\n\nIts guises continued changing through the 1900s. In the first two decades of the 20th century, French couturier Paul Poiret created dresses in pale and pastel pinks, as well as bolder cherry, coral and fuchsia, propelling the shade back into the realm of high fashion. By the 1950s, pink had become more gender-coded than ever, thanks to branding and marketing in postwar America that used it as a symbol of hyper-femininity, cementing a pervasive \"pink for girls, blue for boys\" stereotype.\n\n\"Society decides what colors mean,\" said Steele, who is also the director of the Museum at New York's Fashion Institute of Technology, where an exhibition on the color pink is currently on show. \"When that particular divide was made, it reinforced the perception of pink as a frivolous, because of its association with women, who have been traditionally looked down upon.\"\n\nWhy the color red turns us on\n\nShifting significance\n\nPink regained some its allure around the 1960s, when public figures such as Jackie Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe adopted it as mark of luxury. Punk bands like The Ramones and The Clash made it edgier in the 1980s, while in more recent decades, pop, celebrity and hip-hop cultures have embraced the color in different ways -- from Madonna performing in a Jean Paul Gaultier soft pink cone-cupped bustier in 1990, to rapper Cam'ron attending New York Fashion Week in a pink mink coat and matching hat in 2002, helping to show that pink could again be considered a men's color.\n\nNonetheless, Europeans and Americans repeatedly describe it as one of their least favorite colors in polls.\n\n\"All colors have complications.\" Steele said. \"But I do think that pink is one of the most controversial ones -- and one of the most divisive, too. It arouses very strong emotions, whether good or bad.\"\n\nFenty Puma by Rihanna, Spring/Summer 2017. Credit: Tim Walker/Puma\n\nPink continues to be be received in wildly different ways around the world. Steele believes that Asian cultures are often more partial to pink than Western ones, with her book pointing to Japan in particular, where cosplay and the notion of a \"youth-oriented, feminized cuteness\" have made pink the color of choice for a whole sub-culture of urban \"Lolitas\" sporting doll-like styles.\n\nIn India, pink has long been understood as a hue for both sexes, with men commonly wearing pink clothing, adornments and turbans -- particularly in the north Indian state of Rajasthan.\n\nPink has also been embraced as a color of protest and awareness for various other communities. Pink triangles, once used in concentration camps by the Nazis to identify homosexuals, became a symbol of gay activism in the 1970s. The shade has been increasingly associated with the LGBTQ community, with Steele's book noting how, in France, AIDS was sometimes referred to as \"the pink plague.\"\n\nA model walks the runway at Steve Boi Presents \"Pink\" show during New York Fashion Week. Credit: Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nElsewhere, it has become internationally synonymous with the fight against breast cancer, in the form of a pink ribbon. In the US, meanwhile, female protesters have been wearing pink to signify ownership of their sexual, reproductive and social rights.\n\n\"Pink is going through a generational shift,\" Steele said. \"Society is increasingly moving away from the idea of it as a childish, over-sexualized hue. There's a shared recognition that pink can be pretty and powerful, feminine and feminist. Men are turning to it, too -- as (they did) in the 18th century. We're re-framing pink.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/history-of-color-pink/index.html", "published": "2018-11-01T03:00:14+00:00"}, {"title": "Olafur Eliasson: The man who creates bold new worlds to remind us we only have one", "text": "Jacopo Prisco , CNN Written by\n\nOlafur Eliasson likes to play with fire -- but also ice, light, temperature and pressure. His larger-than-life art installations remix the elements and shock the senses to provoke a reaction, physical as much as emotional, in the viewer.\n\nFor his seminal 2003 installation \"The Weather Project,\" he put the sun and the sky in a hall of London's Tate Modern gallery, complete with 200 lamps, mist machines and its own weather forecast service. People reacted to it in unprecedented ways: They started lying down to watch themselves in the mirrored ceiling, organized picnics, came in fancy dress -- someone even brought a canoe.\n\nOlafur Eliasson's \"The Weather Project.\" Credit: Phaidon\n\nSuch a reaction is what he was hoping for: \"When we are in a museum or a gallery, we are in a space in which exploration feels possible. It's a situation where we've been cultivated to take more risks than we would in a street or a private space,\" said the Danish-Icelandic artist who's in London for the release of Phaidon's \" Olafur Eliasson: Experience, \" a guide to three decades of his art.\n\n\"You behave differently when you're moving through an art installation, which allows you to explore movement and the consequences on your body. It drives your brain into your body. It connects them at least.\"\n\nThis is what great cultural institutions are there for, Eliasson said. \"They are an opportunity for people to almost do a little fact-checking: Do I actually feel myself or have I become numb? That's why it's sometimes hard work to go to a museum -- it's not like going to a shopping mall, where you're just being pleased, you're kind of sleepwalking. In a great cultural institution, you're being provoked, and you have to have an opinion about something.\"\n\nThe awe-inspiring art of Olafur Eliasson\n\n\"The Weather Project\" didn't immediately stimulate an environmental discussion -- in 2003 climate action was hardly the order of the day -- but it undoubtedly represents Eliasson's first step into that arena. Since then, he's often earned the moniker of \"environmental artist.\"\n\nIn 2015, as world leaders were about to sign the Paris climate agreement, which the United States withdrew from in 2017, Eliasson put 12 massive blocks of glacial ice in a Parisian street for people to touch. Harvested as free-floating icebergs from a fjord in Greenland, they were meant as a stark reminder of the critical state of the Arctic ice caps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 18 Danish-Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson has created several spectacular waterfalls, including this one in Versailles, near Paris, in 2016.

And it struck me that people would say, 'Oh! This is cold!' -- even though theoretically we know very well that ice is cold. But it just shows us that the physical relationship with the world and the knowledge about the world are disconnected.\"\n\n\"Riverbed,\" a 2014 installation made with water and Icelandic rock, at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art. Credit: Phaidon\n\nThat's why the threat of climate change, he said, does not give us enough sense of risk to result in actual action. An emotional experience, on the other hand, can be a stronger driver of behavioral change than theoretical data.\n\n\"Climate awareness has never been so high,\" he said. \"There is basically no place in the world where a 12-year-old does not know what global warming is. We are reaching the point where everybody on the whole planet is being introduced to the notion of the greenhouse effect. So the headlines are not so good, but the trends underneath is. We don't see convergence, we don't see execution, we don't see commitment yet. But I do think we are seeing change.\"\n\nThat the cultural sector has been a massive source of that change is not surprising to Eliasson: \"There is more money in the cultural sector than in the car industry,\" he said. \"We just forget it because it's decentralized, it's messy, it's chaotic. We think it's a small thing but it's not, it's like a huge network of things that are actually reflecting on critical questions.\"\n\nCan art save the world then? Eliasson said he is optimistic about the power, and the responsibility, of culture to inspire action despite \"a lot of old institutions still governed by old white guys with white hair who have been sitting there way too long.\"\n\n\"How can we organize our narrative so that we can have a more intimate relationship with the greater civic society? Maybe the cultural sector can offer solutions to some of the things that politicians are struggling with, such as not reacting on the climate -- because they're not,\" he said.\n\nEliasson has often earned the moniker of \"environmental artist.\" Credit: Phaidon\n\nIn 2012, Eliasson founded Little Sun , a company that makes solar-powered products designed to replace kerosene lamps and power small electrical items in areas without a grid, such as sub-Saharan Africa. But it would be limiting to paint his interests and creations as confined to the environment.\n\nFor two months he opened a pop-up restaurant in Reykjavik, Iceland, with his sister and chef Victoria El\u00edasd\u00f3ttir, inspired by the communal kitchen of his Berlin studio, which employs about 100 people. His passion for food is such that an upcoming personal retrospective he's putting together at London's Tate, opening in late 2019, might well include a full-size restaurant, too.\n\nAbout the still work-in-progress exhibition, he's only willing to say, \"I'm happy to report it takes on a slightly larger ambition than my shows otherwise.\" Brace yourselves.\n\nEliasson has also founded an architectural practice, which has recently completed its first building, a castle-like office block in Denmark. His previous flirts with architecture have resulted in the acclaimed Harpa Concert Hall in Reykjavik and the 2007 Serpentine Pavilion in London, among other efforts.\n\n\"I've worked with architects and in the process I've really come to appreciate the great artistic craft of architecture.

He was never in any doubt, he says; he simply wasn't good at anything else. And so a designer is what he became.\n\nWe are sitting at a table in his open plan office cum workshop in London's King's Cross neighborhood, drinking iced water and nibbling on madeleines, apparently fresh from the oven. We are surrounded by models of Heatherwick projects: the British pavilion for the Shanghai Expo 2010 (\"The hairy design,\" he calls it, referring to its 60,000 swaying optical rods); the Bombay Sapphire Distillery in Hampshire; the revamped London Routemaster double-decker bus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 6 The UK pavilion at World Expo 2010 in Shanghai.

I ask Heatherwick whether he shops much himself, but never really get a definitive answer. He demurs. He settled on his own sartorial look a while ago: the hair always tousled, white shirt, baggy pants. And this afternoon, a sleeveless Nehru jacket.\n\nHeatherwick is mainly interested in \"the social dynamic of shopping as an excuse for bringing people together,\" he says. He is acutely aware that we live in a digital age. Anything that brings us together -- as a substitute for old community catalysts like religion and the public library -- has even greater importance.\n\nCourtesy Luke Hayes\n\nCoal Drops Yard is the latest addition to the expansive and ongoing redevelopment of buildings and pedestrian spaces surrounding the train stations of King's Cross and St Pancras. Heatherwick Studio has refurbished a pair of Victorian sheds on the edge of the canal site that were once used for the storage and distribution of coal around London by horse and cart. Heatherwick describes them as \"a funny pair of buildings with lots of idiosyncrasies.\" The two were derelict, standing almost parallel \"like skis\" or \"two broken KitKat fingers,\" he says. The developer had wanted a bridge of some kind between them.\n\nGrain silo transformed into striking museum\n\nThe historical palette -- charcoal roof and walls, and pavement of reddish-brown brick -- has been respected, but the most striking feature is the new roofs. They're still made of traditional Welsh slate (\"From the original seam,\" Heatherwick points out) but now they sweep up into the air like a rockabilly quiff, veer across the divide and meet in the middle.\n\n\"(The challenge was) to create a heart to the project, something to pull people together,\" he says. \"Some of team call it 'the kissing point.'\"\n\nCourtesy Luke Hayes\n\nFinding a symbolic heart and instilling emotion into projects seems to be a recurring theme in his work. Heatherwick cites the influence of the late American-Canadian activist Jane Jacobs, author of a seminal work, \"The Death and Life of Great American Cities.\" Jacobs believed passionately in a fresh community based approach to city development, and Heatherwick evidently shares this passion. He's interested in \"what makes streets come alive and makes you feel safe.\"\n\nHeatherwick actively dislikes the term \"shopping mall.\" (\"A gross word,\" he mutters.) Instead, he likens Coal Drops Yard, his fourth retail development, to \"a new high street,\" designed around the human experience and how shoppers connect with buildings.\n\nThe new third floor, under Coal Drops Yard's sinuous roof, is to become a Samsung outlet. A Paul Smith shop is on the ground floor and the designer Tom Dixon has set up new headquarters, a shop and a restaurant just yards away. Students from the neighboring art college, Central Saint Martins, will have an opportunity to show their work in some of the smaller spaces.\n\nCourtesy Hufton & Crow\n\nSuccess seems to have come very quickly for Heatherwick. As a teenage student at the liberal (and since shut) Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley, he was exposed to what he calls \"alternative thinkers.\" This was followed by study in three-dimensional design at Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University) and London's Royal College of Art. At 24, he founded Heatherwick Studio, setting up in a small office in Camden in North London.\n\n\"It was just me,\" he says simply. \"I just kept asking myself, 'Why isn't that better? This could be better.'\"\n\nHeatherwick admits he expected to be working in obscurity: \"I never expected the range of projects, never dreamed of (a studio of) 200 people.\" But 24 years later, at 48, that's how it's turned out. As of now, Heatherwick Studio has taken on more than 30 projects in Europe, Asia, America, the Middle East and Africa\n\nThe studio is currently working an airport terminal in Singapore and a mixed-use development featuring giant tree-covered concrete columns in Shanghai. The project is simply called 1000 Trees. Heatherwick has a floating park in a similar idiom, Pier 55, under construction in New York.\n\nThere is a new headquarters for Google in California, designed with Bjarke Ingels' BIG firm, that has just been topped out. He excitedly shows me the gleaming model. He likens the roof to a series of \"flying handkerchiefs, a solar fabric to power the entire building.\"\n\nCourtesy Luke Hayes\n\nHeatherwick has had his setbacks and his critics. Most recently, his design for an ambitious Garden Bridge across London's river Thames was abandoned last year amid widespread criticism, spiraling construction costs and the withdrawal of mayoral support.\n\nI ask him what makes his practice different from others. His aim, he says, is \"to fill the gaps, what others aren't doing. We (designers) are supposed to think differently. You can't take space for granted.\"\n\nOur allotted interview time of an hour overruns by 10 minutes, while Heatherwick is in full flow.

But equally, he's also always had a good memory for figures -- for the pounds, shillings and pence. As a student at London's Royal College of Art, he remembers selling a drawing to a friend and fellow student, the American painter Ron Kitaj, for a princely \u00a35. It meant that he could buy cigarettes in packs of 20. He sold another early painting, \"Adhesiveness\" (1960), to photographer Cecil Beaton for \u00a340. That meant he could begin planning to travel abroad.\n\nAs it happens, Hockney also has a clear memory of what \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" originally fetched shortly after he painted it. On Thursday, at a Christie's auction in New York , the painting was sold for $90.3 million, an auction record for a living artist. But back in 1972, his New York dealer sold it for just $18,000.\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Courtesy Christie's\n\nFor Hockney, the memory is still bittersweet. He felt ripped off. Last year, at his studio in the Hollywood Hills, he told CNN, \"I thought it was a lot of money at the time, but within six months, it was sold again for $50,000.\"\n\nAfter the sale, Hockney's American dealer, Andre Emmerich, \"realized the pictures (in the show) were underpriced. A lot had been underpriced.\" But by then, it was too late. And so, as is often the case in the art market, someone other than the artist made a swift and substantial profit.\n\nHockney at 80: An encounter with the artist\n\nMore is known about the creation of \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" than virtually any other single Hockney painting. The 1974 biopic \"A Bigger Splash\" chronicled its creation, and Hockney himself wrote about the painting in detail in 1988's \"David Hockney by David Hockney: My Early Years.\"\n\n\"A Bigger Splash\" was shot from 1971 to 1973 by British director Jack Hazan, who was given special access to Hockney, then living and working in London's Notting Hill, and his inner circle. A mix of fact and fiction, it centers on the painful unraveling of Hockney's five-year relationship with a young American artist, Peter Schlesinger.\n\nHockney told CNN the painting was inspired by an accidental juxtaposition of \"two photographs on my studio floor, one of the Peter and another of a swimmer, and they were just lying there and I put them together.\" In his 1988 memoir, \"David Hockney by David Hockney: My Early Years,\" he wrote: \"The idea of painting two figures in different styles appealed so much that I began the painting immediately.\"\n\nHe worked on the picture for six solid months. The standing figure was always Peter Schlesinger. According to his official biographer, Christopher Simon Sykes, Hockney painted the swimmer first but then coated the canvas with a preparatory gesso, which prevented him from altering the position of the pool or the standing figure. It was a mistake.\n\nHockney gradually realized the painting -- in particular, the angle of the swimming pool -- just wasn't right. He wrote that, \"The figures never related to one another nor to the background. I changed the setting constantly from distant mountains to a claustrophobic wall and back again to mountains. I even tried a glass wall.\"\n\nDavid Hockney in his Hollywood Hills studio in 2017.\n\nRealizing the futility of his efforts, Hockney abandoned that effort and, reinvigorated, started the painting all over again. He chose a new setting, a pool by a house in the south of France that belonged to British film director Tony Richardson. He took two models with him: a photographer named John St. Clair and Mo McDermott, his studio assistant.\n\nHe took hundreds of photos of the two. St. Clair, the submerged swimmer, dived into the pool in his white briefs so many times that he eventually cracked his head on the bottom and had to stop. McDermott acted as Schlesinger's stand-in, wearing his reddish pink jacket by the pool. Back in London, Hockney persuaded Schlesinger to pose for him early one morning in Hyde Park for yet more photos.\n\nPeter Schlesinger and artist David Hockney standing in front of a photograph of themselves at a 1969 exhibition in London. Credit: Patrick Lichfield/Conde Nast Collection Editorial\n\nOnce back at his Notting Hill studio, Hockney painted for 18 hours a day on a canvas seven feet by 10. At one point, Hockney is filmed taking a Polaroid of the unfinished painting. At another moment, he paints in Schlesinger's brown hair with a long brush. \"I must admit that I loved working on that picture, working with such intensity,\" he later told biographer Sykes. \"It was marvelous doing it, really thrilling.\"\n\nWhile he spent six months of the first version, the final \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" was finished in just two weeks, to meet a deadline for a New York show in May 1972. In \"A Bigger Splash,\" Hockney, with his trademark bleached blond hair and black, owlish spectacles, stands in bright red braces and a bow tie, carefully checking out how the painting was hung and lit in the show. It was the star exhibit, perhaps an expression of Hockney's personal loss and his acceptance that his long affair with Schlesinger was finally over.\n\nWhy is art so expensive?\n\nBut as we now know, all this wasn't without a sense of Hockney feeling cheated by what happened next. An American, apparently alerted by a British dealer, just came in off the street and bought it. The dealer then promptly took it to an art fair in Germany and sold it to a London collector for nearly three times the price. As he wrote in \"My Early Years\": \"Within a year people had made far more on that picture than Kasmin (John Kasmin, his London dealer), Andre (Emmerich, his New York dealer) or I had. Considering the effort and trouble and everything that had gone into it, it seemed such a cheap thing to do.\"\n\nWe can only imagine how Hockney will feel after this sale, when the painting he worked so hard on has sold for more than 5,000 times its original price. The current seller and the auction house will no doubt profit, but, as a Christie's spokesperson confirmed, \"the artist will not be financially benefiting.\"\n\nChristie's hasn't named the seller, but he's believed to be British businessman Joe Lewis, who has famously collected postwar British art for some time.\n\nAt 81, Lewis happens to be the same age as Hockney. He also has a net worth of $5 billion.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/david-hockney-painting-90-million-auction-record/index.html", "published": "2018-11-16T01:02:07+00:00"}, {"title": "What will Versace look like under Michael Kors?", "text": "Written by Samantha Tse, CNN\n\nSamantha Tse is an experienced fashion writer and editor. Her work has been published in several international publications including T Magazine, Women's Wear Daily, CNN Style, Allure and Disegno.\n\nIt was announced yesterday that American fashion brand Michael Kors had snapped up famed label Versace for $2.1 billion , taking over one of the last independent Italian brands in an effort to build an empire to rival major European conglomerates LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton (whose stable of brands includes Givenchy, Fendi, Dior among many others) and Kering (Gucci, Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga and others).\n\nWith Versace and Jimmy Choo (purchased in 2017) under his belt, Kors, who will rename his company Capri Holdings Limited upon completion of the sale, is already wreaking havoc in the existing power structure that has dominated luxury fashion since the 1990s. The question now is whether the American designer and his chief executive and chairman John Idol can succeed where their other countrymen have failed and create America's first luxury group.\n\n\"Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.\"\n\nVersace executive Jonathan Akeroyd, designer Donatella Versace and Michael Kors CEO John Idol.

Provided it works, it places him in a league apart from his rivals such as Ralph Lauren,\" fashion historian Bronwyn Cosgrave said in a phone interview. \"He will not only be the figurehead behind his own name brand but could become known for revitalizing a legendary European brand, which no American designer has accomplished.\"\n\nWhat does the acquisition mean for both brands and what will they gain by joining up?\n\nMichael Kors and Versace are two brands who are known for their seduction and glamor, albeit at different ends of the spectrum, but the venture could be highly advantageous to both parties.\n\nLong Island-born Michael Kors launched his brand in 1981 and has built his empire selling aesthetics drawn from the American jet-set lifestyle.

The brand has a strong focus on accessories ranging from bags to shoes and watches, which are coveted both in America and in Europe. And, the American designer is a household name through his fashion label but also because of his 10-year stint as a judge on Project Runway.\n\nVersace, on the other hand, is the epitome of Italian fashion: high-octane glamour and sex appeal at a very high price point. Whereas the Kors women has a healthy athletic glow and good manners, the Versace muse is a bronzed goddess, swigging champagne until the early hours.\n\nVersace is also a household name, but more so for its association with celebrities like Jennifer Lopez, who wore the now infamous green silk dress with a neckline that dipped to her naval, and Elizabeth Hurley, whose Versace safety pin dress catapulted her into stardom.\n\nVersace Spring-Summer 2019 Credit: MIGUEL MEDINA/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nVersace was founded by Gianni Versace in 1978. Until his murder in 1997, he ran the creative side of the business and was credited with creating the supermodel phenomenon of the 1980s and 90s, championing diversity and blending high fashion with pop culture. After his death, his sister Donatella took over the brand. (She will remain as its creative director after the sale.)\n\nWhat's the drama?\n\nIt's no surprise that a sale of this magnitude has raised some eyebrows. Some of the controversy stems from Versace, a brand historically aligned with Italian heritage, culture and craftsmanship, being purchased by an American company that has made its money in malls. But Versace has also suffered because of its lack of accessibility. For many luxury houses, makeup or accessories are the entry point, areas where Versace lags. While it produces handbags and shoes, none of it is particularly coveted or seen as a must-have product.\n\nMichael Kors' chief executive and chairman John Idol wants to remedy this. His strategy for Versace, as outlined in a statement by the brand, includes an increase in accessories and footwear, and the opening of approximately 100 new stores around the world. Idol aims to grow Versace's revenue to $2 billion in the long term.\n\nDonatella Versace: A fashion icon ft. Lady Gaga\n\n\"(Kors) also has immense credibility in this space. While Michael Kors handbags today are as sought after as Prada in Europe, Mr. Kors was also instrumental in revitalizing Celine. His seven-year tenure there transformed it from virtually dormant to relevant,\" said Cosgrave. \"With his own brand, he seems to have made it a success by distilling European fashion trends to the American market. He has a solid track record creating ready-to-wear and perhaps this can lend credibility to Versace,\" Cosgrave said.\n\nMichael Kors isn't the first American to try to create a homegrown version of the conglomerates that dominate European luxury. Several have tried, including Liz Claiborne who purchased American mid-market brands Juicy Couture, Lucky Brand jeans and Kate Spade in 2012. Most recently Tapestry who owns Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, is trying to enter the arena but Kors is planning a group of a different kind: one whose focus is global rather than harvesting only American brands.\n\nWith Jimmy Choo and Versace under his belt, he's got his gloves on and is ready to enter the ring. Kors may be the underdog now but as the American fashion company is slowly wedging its way into an arena heavily dominated by European conglomerates. And by amalgamating luxury European brands into the American fold, he is both giving American luxury a one-up on the global stage, and dissolving fashion borders that have been tied to class and national heritage, and creating a more global approach within the industry.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/what-will-versace-look-like-under-michael-kors/index.html", "published": "2018-09-26T14:54:40+00:00"}, {"title": "Controversial high-speed rail station opens in Hong Kong", "text": "Written by Stephy Chung, CNN Hong Kong\n\nIt has been heralded as a vision of the future. A $10.75 billion infrastructure investment connecting Hong Kong with China's high-speed rail network.\n\nThe West Kowloon Station, which is set to open today, will serve as an underground terminus for an expected 80,100 passengers daily, with the rail link promising to cut the two-hour journey time between Hong Kong and the Chinese city of Guangzhou to a mere 47 minutes.\n\nBut the glittering, wave-shaped development has proven to be controversial. A future some in Hong Kong neither wanted nor asked for.\n\nCritics have lambasted the approximately 400,000 square-meter station and the Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link, questioning the cost of the project which is 30% over the estimated budget, and pointing out that the city already has regular rail links with mainland China.\n\nBut a bigger and more contentious flashpoint has been its joint-immigration checkpoints.\n\nDue to its relatively short distance, the Hong Kong section of the Express Rail Link has a maximum speed of 200 kilometers per hour (kph), much lower than the top speed of 300 kph China's bullet trains usually hit. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nAlthough it is part of China, Hong Kong is separated by a fixed border and governed under a separate legal framework that grants it political and legal freedoms not available on the mainland.\n\nThis \"Trojan train,\" as one political commentator put it , will cut straight into the heart of the city, where mainland immigration officers stationed at the terminus will be able to enforce Chinese law on Hong Kong soil for the first time.\n\nConcerns surrounding the Chinese government's ability to operate with impunity within the city have increased in recent years, following the alleged \"involuntary removal\" of a Hong Kong bookseller to mainland China in 2015.\n\nAs of Sunday, a part of the new station, as well as compartments of the trains traveling to and from mainland China, will come under the jurisdiction of Beijing.\n\n\"I think it's unprecedented and violates the 'one country, two systems' principle,\" said Hong Kong politician Lam Cheuk-Ting, referring to the city's unique political arrangement with Beijing.\n\n\"It will threaten the autonomy of Hong Kong,\" added Lam.\n\nDivisive architecture\n\nIn the past, the development of major infrastructure projects in Hong Kong had coincided with periods of unrest in mainland China, providing a veneer of comparative stability.\n\nThe Kowloon-Canton Railway, completed in 1912, and the first cross-harbor tunnel finished in the early 1970s, are two such examples, according to Cole Roskam, an associate professor of architectural theory and history at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe former was constructed as the Qing Dynasty in China was being overthrown, while the latter was completed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nWhereas earlier colonial-era projects \"helped to reassure the public regarding Hong Kong's future, these recent projects seem to have stoked more anxiety,\" said Roskam in an e-mail, referring to both the station and another new project, the world's longest sea-crossing bridge connecting Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\n\"I think it has to do with fear, resentment, and anxiety over China and perceptions of Hong Kong's diminished standing vis-a-vis China,\" said Roskam.\n\nThe station is located north of the West Kowloon Cultural District. Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nThe Hong Kong government, however, views the station as a more \"convenient means of cross-boundary transport\" and, more importantly, as a tool to boost the city's economic opportunities.\n\nFrank Chan, the secretary for transport and housing, called the project, \"a historic moment,\" during a press conference in August.\n\n\"It will foster commercial and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and mainland cities and enhance Hong Kong's status as a transport hub,\" said Chan.\n\nThe station has views of Hong Kong's Central skyline and Victoria Peak.

Credit: Courtesy Aedas\n\nOutside, softer touches, like a grass-covered roof structure that gestures towards the nearby Victoria Harbor, are meant to be public-friendly.\n\n\"I think its quite striking, formally. It's clearly an effort to capture the dynamism of the high-speed train. There's a tautness to the overall form that captures its proximity to the water, and the way it will abruptly deposit travelers on the harbor's edge,\" said Roskam.\n\nWhile the Hong Kong government funded the terminus, its design carries noticeable similarities with modern train stations across the border -- fitting neatly into China's greater building narrative of what the high-speed rail network has come to represent.\n\nIn China, the stations are seen as signature markers of the country's progress, though as architecture expert Aric Chen points out, some are more impressive than others.\n\n\"The ones that aim to impress almost invariably have, in their design, a soaring space and dynamic movement,\" said Chen, who until recently was the lead curator of architecture and design at Hong Kong museum M+.\n\nThe mammoth Guangzhou South Railway Station , for instance, is three times the size of London's King Cross Station. One of the most prominent features is an arched central spine that floods the station with natural light.\n\nThe Beijing South Railway Station , which opened in 2008 to coincide with the country's transformative Summer Olympics, boasts a clean, ultra-modern elliptical geometry that caters to the passenger flow.\n\n'Excitement of technology'\n\nChina began constructing its high-speed rail in earnest, back in 2008. In just a decade since, 15,500 miles of track have been laid, making it the world's most extensive high-speed rail network.\n\nAn estimated 4 million passengers commute on some 4,000 bullet trains daily, according to China Railway\n\nHundreds of newly built or refurbished stations have been opened to accommodate the high-speed lines. Station designs often try to \"express the excitement of technology, or the speed of travel,\" according to Chen.\n\nConstruction of the project.

These stations are the entry points for a network that is literally tying the country together in a way it hasn't been tied before.\"\n\nModern day high-speed rail stations are a unique building type, often-colossal spaces that have to account for advanced tech and subsequent electricity needs, and designed to accommodate for buses, underground metros and street vehicles.\n\nThe grass-covered roof of the station will be a pedestrian-friendly park.

They become these symbolic gateways to these rapidly developing cities, linking them together,\" said Chen.\n\nAuthor Charlie Xue likens their functionality to that of airport terminals.\n\n\"In many cities like Guangzhou and Shanghai, the stations have more than 20 lines, and are all elevated. The design relates to the complicated technology of these trains, the trains (moving) in and out, and the circulation of people.\n\n\"Trains have always been an important in China. People physically and psychologically rely on them,\" Xue added.\n\n\"During the Chinese New Year, you see hundreds of millions of people gathering at stations, moving by trains.

Scroll through to discover CNN Style's top picks. Credit: A24\n\nThe camera moves on, but the mise en scene is established. The uncanny is turned loose, the real and the phantasmagoric emulsified. These characters are the playthings of some external force, the setting a willing conspirator. Home is where the horror is.\n\nSuch ideas are not new to the genre, and whether it wants to admit it or not, Aster's film is the convergence of so many of horror's expressions of the domestic sphere. To speak nothing of the plot (and it's best not to) the writer-director exploits everything from Greek tragedy to Gothic literature to 1980s slasher flicks, with dashes of \"Rosemary's Baby,\" \"Don't Look Now\" and \"The Shining\" all stirred into his nightmarish cocktail.\n\nRevolving around a stay-at-home artist untethered by grief, Toni Collette's performance is receiving early Oscar buzz. But every actor needs a stage, and the one conjured by production designer Grace Yun deserves attention -- it too is a character in its own right.\n\nThe family home is a profoundly unsettling space, even if we have seen some of these ideas before. This familiarity begs the question: why are we still so scared? And secondly: why do we keep coming back for more?\n\nNo safe spaces\n\nFrench philosopher Gaston Bachelard writes in \"The Poetics of Space,\" \"If one would ask us what is the most precious benefaction of the house, we would say: the house accommodates dreaming, the house protects the dreamer, the house allows us to dream in peace.\"\n\nIt follows that if peace and protection is stripped away from the house, it presents something of an existential crisis to its occupants. (Darren Aronofsky's \"mother!,\" cloaked in grandiose allegory, had this simple idea at its heart.)\n\nIn \"mother!\" Jennifer Lawrence faced a host of unwelcome guests, who derailed her home makeover with disasterous consequences. Credit: Niko Tavernise/Paramount\n\nHowever it manifests, we all fear a loss of control over our perceived safe space. But perception is both subjective and objective. Some question whether homes can ever be safe spaces -- none more gleefully than \"the master of suspense\" himself, Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nIn 1965 Hitchcock famously quipped that \"one of television's greatest contributions is that it brought murder back into the home, where it belongs.\" The director's aphorism rings true -- homes are, in many ways, brimming with violence.\n\nThe killer in \"Scream\" (1996). A classic case of violent crimes committed by persons close to the victim. Credit: Dimension Films\n\n\"They're places rife with tension: psychological violence, emotional violence, and in some cases, literal violence,\" said Mark Jancovich, professor of film studies at the University of East Anglia. \"We imagine (violent threats are) external, we want to believe they're external, but actually they frequently bubble up from within.\"\n\n\"We may be locking ourselves in with the very people we should fear most,\" he added, chillingly. Statistics bear this out. In the US between 2005-2010, strangers accounted for only 9% of violent crimes committed in the victim's home\n\nIn any case, we still want to believe our house is a safe space. Horror films set in homes actually might help us in this regard.\n\nThere's an argument that watching scary movies is cathartic: a consequence-free simulation of our worst anxieties and fears. The experience is stressful, but ultimately rewarding given that when the credits roll we can return to reality unscathed. Aristotle might suggest the catharsis helps us explore and understand our fears, and so when we think about our home, we can use this knowledge to assert a sense of control back over it.\n\nYun says she suffered nightmares while crafting \"Hereditary's\" domicile. In theory at least, they weren't for nothing.\n\nOut of sight, not out of mind\n\nIt may take a while to convince audiences the film is a positive mental experience. Nevertheless, viewed through this lens the home becomes a switchboard, and there's plenty of ways Yun and Aster can plug into our fears.\n\nThe Graham family's 20th-century house is rural enough to evoke Gothic mansions but built with a modern sensibility. Its interiors, with wood-paneled walls and cast-iron bedframes, is a stately home on a suburban budget.

Credit: Reid Chavis/courtesy of A24\n\n\"(Ari and I) didn't want it to look decrepit,\" said Yun in a phone interview, \"we wanted it to ride the line of believability.\" At first glance the place is, but the devil's in the detail. Annie's deceased, ornery mother once lived in the house. Her influence has seeped into the timber, and echoes unsolicited down the maternal line.\n\nLegendary director Dario Argento has argued that \" without psychology, the horror film doesn't exist .\" Grief is as much a source of horror as the paranormal in \"Hereditary,\" and both are reflected in the design. Annie's studio is filled with miniatures of her home life, real and imagined, life-like scenes as accurate as they are disturbing. \"As an artist (they're) her way to process traumatic events -- events that are unresolved for her,\" said Yun.\n\nToni Colette as grieving artist Annie works on a minature in her at-home studio. Credit: Reid Chavis/A24\n\nThe domestic dioramas she makes spill out into the full-scale home. Yun researched dolls' houses and noticed the way each room had its own defined aesthetic -- color schemes, wallpaper patterns and symmetry. Reverse-engineering the house, she subtly made sure \"each room had its own unique aspect to it.\"\n\nIt helps audiences navigate the space, Yun explained, but also offers a sense \"you're trapped inside Annie's artwork.\" Freud's literal translation of the German \" unheimlich ,\" from which the uncanny derives, is \"unhomely.\" Both are apt descriptions for the effect Yun creates.\n\nCuriously, Yun admitted she's \"not well-versed\" in the horror genre. \"Ari thought my ignorance was somehow a benefit,\" she said, given he \"didn't want a photocopy\" of what was already out there. It's interesting -- and perhaps speaks to something unconscious -- that the way Aster uses the house, constructed to accommodate his 80-page shot list, evokes some genre staples.\n\nGary Oldman transforms into Winston Churchill\n\nOver 100 years of scary movies have codified home interiors. We know from \"Psycho,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" and recently \"Get Out,\" that entering basements is a fraught with danger. Attics are zones of perilous discovery for trespassers (\"The Innocents\"), and a space where occupants confront uncomfortable parts of themselves (\"Jane Eyre\").\n\nTed Levine as Buffalo Bill, the serial killer in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" who skinned his victims in a basement workshop. Credit: AF archive/Alamy\n\nIn life, so in horror cinema, \"you need a sealed off space,\" said Jancovich. We can't live among everything we own, he argued, and we choose what to put on show. Thinking of the house as a metaphor for the brain, there are peripheral spaces where we push possessions -- or memories or thoughts we don't want to confront but can't let go of -- out of sight and out of mind. Combined, these spaces can become a repository for our fears.\n\nThrough repetition of space and symbol, the genre does a lot to reinforce its own visual language. In \"Hereditary,\" as Annie hovers in front of her mother's bedroom door, we know without prompting that no good can lie behind it.\n\nThat's not to say Aster's film isn't original, or its home not subtle. For instance, the way Yun fleshes out the character of Annie's reticent daughter Charlie (Milly Shapiro), with an outr\u00e9 studio of her own, is a twisted delight which invites close inspection and spawned its own Etsy page\n\nCharlie's workshop, where she crafts figurines from salvaged goods -- including dead animals. Credit: Reid Chavis/courtesy of A24\n\n\"(Aster) loves films that, when you go and watch it again, you discover something new, you discover another layer,\" said Yun. Her production design is full of details and motifs that will only register on a second or third viewing. Annie's other miniature houses dotted around the home deserve scrutiny, for one. \"I don't want to give too much away,\" she said, \"but all that stuff was thought about, for sure.\"\n\n\"This design was trying to be evocative,\" Yun reflected. \"I feel like I did birth something at the end,\" she added, \"it was cathartic in a way.\"\n\nYun may feel purged, but audiences have all that to come.

The views expressed here are the author's own.\n\nWhile most of us have never fallen prey to a cult, that doesn't mean we've escaped their allure entirely. Many of us are still captivated by the mythologies behind these dubious and sometimes dangerous sects, and the wealth of films, television shows and books on the subject is surely proof of our enduring fascination.\n\nRecent years have seen the likes of HBO's \"Big Love\" and \"Going Clear,\" as well as Louis Theroux's \"My Scientology Documentary\" and the eerie \"Martha, Marcy, May, Marlene\" delve into the disturbing world of cults. Netflix's \"Wild Wild Country\" is the latest entry into the genre.\n\nThe six-part documentary series tells the bizarre story of how Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, also known as Osho, and his followers took up residence in rural Oregon, embarking on a campaign of bioterrorism against the enraged local community.\n\nAside from all the poisoning, politics and preaching, Rajneesh's followers were notable in the way they presented themselves in quasi-Buddhist red and orange robes, occasionally combined with a turtleneck and beads. In contrast to the wide collars and kipper ties of the native Oregonians, the \"orange people\" as they were sometimes referred to looked like from a different planet.\n\nGuru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh and his disciples in Oregon, USA. Credit: Matthew NAYTHONS/Gamma-Rapho/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nThe Rajneeshan's sartorial efforts weren't fully appreciated at the time, but they've recently found many fans on the internet. Enthusiasts of the show cheerfully share images, and a number of fashion sites run pieces on how to get the Rajneeshan look. In fact, looking at pictures of the cult, you could be forgiven for believing you'd been given a preview of the latest Alessandro Michele collection for Gucci, with all the 70's glad rags and lustrous manes of hair.\n\nSuch a strong focus on visual identity isn't unusual in cults. Leaders are often keen to create a distinct image, combing through historical and religious iconography to draw people into their ranks.\n\nRelated Video: Who decides what we wear?\n\nHow uniforms attract followers\n\nHistory has long shown that if you want to get people to behave as you want, a uniform can go a long way. \"A uniform is usually a clean slate, a starting point,\" said Alex Esculapio, a writer and Ph.D. candidate with a focus on fashion and sociology. \"It shows you're not alone and you belong to a group of people. It becomes your new identity, and really signals a new start.\"\n\nWhether it's cults, terrorist groups or paramilitary organizations, violent fringe factions often like to create a recognizable visual identity. Right wing demagogues Oswald Mosley and Mussolini used drab colors, like black and brown, to create an image of militaristic strength, while Marxist groups seem to favor berets and fatigues. At protests around the world you can find the instantly recognizable hoodies of the anti-fascist Black Bloc group. Religious cults might be more spiritual than political, but they clearly understand the power of uniform.\n\nEnglish Leader of the British Union of Fascists Oswald Mosley (1896-1980) with some of his men, including William Joyce (1906-1946), aka Lord Haw Haw (far left). Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n\"The thing that all cults, religions, or any social groups looking to distinguish themselves from mainstream culture have in common is a uniform that really sets them apart and makes all the members look alike. It creates a group identity, which is a signal to outsiders,\" said Esculapio.\n\n\"They're similar to an organized religion, who often have specific uniforms, such as Buddhist monks or Catholic priests, and there's also an overlap with the fashion mentality in general, the idea of style tribes. I think it's a dynamic that is present in all social life, but it becomes heightened in the case of cults.\"\n\nPerhaps the best-known example of this practice is the most violent and notorious cult of all, the so-called Manson family. In their early days at Spahn Ranch, Charles Manson cultivated a carefree, almost pastoral look for his family. The girls grew their hair long and uncombed, wore floral dresses and walked in bare feet. They could almost have been mistaken for a church group on an outing.\n\nBut after a series of brutal killings and a guilty verdict, Charles Manson shaved his head and his remaining supporters followed suit, creating a peculiar pseudo-Eastern look.\n\nThe flip side of the sartorial choices of cults\n\nManson was using aesthetic to both lure people in and to push them away. He created a pastoral, utopian, hippie version of his followers for when they needed to attract lost souls and runaways, and then turned them into a violent, freakish nightmare version for when they were put on a world stage.\n\nAnother infamous American cult who used uniform and stylistic language to create a feeling of purpose and vision was the suicide sect Heaven's Gate.\n\nThe group shot to worldwide attention in 1997 when 39 members, including group leader Marshall Applewhite, took a lethal dose of phenobarbital and vodka, before laying down to die in adjoining bunk beds. But the most striking element of the photos splashed across the media was that every member was wearing the same pair of Nike Decade trainers and black jogging bottoms.\n\nAs morbid as these images were, the pictures of the cult members' feet almost resembled a controversial fashion campaign, a feeling which was cemented when Saturday Night Live splashed Nike's famous '\"Just Do It\" motto across the images and created a proto-meme straight from the realm of gallows humor.\n\nAlex Esculapio, who has written about Heaven's Gate, believes that the trainers and uniforms were a way to create an identifiable and relatable aesthetic.\n\n\"They were different from a lot of what people might expect from a cult, because they were in touch with fashion. They were really keen on creating a visual identity and had been since the beginning. They had a few different incarnations, but they always used a specific style of clothing to emulate what they saw as aspirational. Nike shoes were particularly popular in the US in the 90's. They had specific grooming rituals, [for example] none of the men had a beard and they shaved their heads.\n\n\"Their neighbor at the time described them as looking like tech-nerds, so obviously they were in touch with what was happening at the time. There was a tension between isolation and hyper-awareness of modern culture, they knew they needed to stay in touch to survive,\" said Esculapio.\n\nSome 4,000 'Moonies,' believers of Unification Church which was named after the founder Moon Sun Myung, attend the mass wedding which began in the early 1960s.

Reverend Jim Jones may have carefully cultivated his own preacher-in-sunglasses image, but his followers looked like they could have been pulled from any mall in America.\n\nThat lack of a distinct visual identity didn't stop more than 900 members from killing themselves in his name. The same goes for David Koresh's Branch Davidians, who visually resembled almost any other community in Texas, yet believed their leader to be the second coming and were willing to die for that.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/seductive-power-of-uniforms-and-cult-dress/index.html", "published": "2018-06-06T23:57:19+00:00"}, {"title": "The soft power impact of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decorative collars", "text": "Written by Rhonda Garelick, CNN\n\nSometimes, fashion's greatest power is its stealth -- its ability to turn up in unlikely places, on unlikely people, and in the smallest details. Consider the case of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , the 85-year-old force of nature who sits on the Supreme Court.\n\nGinsburg learned long ago how to stand out. Forging her distinguished career at a time when women were not seen as appropriate candidates for law school, let alone judgeships, Ginsburg succeeded in being taken seriously, in remaining visible. And she has devoted herself to helping others do the same: advocating for those society tends to overlook, those \"disappeared\" by the blindness of prejudice or sexism.\n\nUS Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Credit: Tim Sloan/Getty Images\n\nToday, as a Supreme Court justice, Ginsburg continues to stand out -- literally, visually -- by virtue of the decorative collars that she famously affixes to her judicial robes.\n\nBeyond a feminizing touch\n\nGiven her historic position and stature -- she's the second female justice, appointed in 1993 -- you might think that Ginsburg would have little need for such sartorial distinction. Yet, her collars make crucial symbolic points, albeit subtly.\n\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Credit: Paul J. Richards/Getty Images\n\nIn adopting the collar, Ginsburg was following a tradition established by Sandra Day O'Connor, the court's first woman (appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981), who sought to feminize her robe with a simple white lace jabot. Ginsburg though, expanded the concept, amassing an entire wardrobe of collars, collected from around the world, in a wide array of styles ranging from simple half-circles of fabric or lace to elaborately beaded and jeweled affairs.\n\nBeyond their role as a feminizing touch, these collars constitute a communication system, a kind of fashion semaphore.\n\nThere is her favorite \"majority\" collar (an embellished gold jabot with tiny, delicate pendants) and her \"dissenting\" collar , for example, which instantly telegraph Ginsburg's opinions (to those court observers fluent in \"Ruth\") before a single word can be uttered. (Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar a day after President Donald Trump's election -- a dark, beaded number composed of long, metallic, finger-like projections, resembling a piece of medieval armor -- throwing sartorial shade while maintaining the official neutrality demanded by protocol).\n\nSupreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's \"majority\" collar. Credit: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nWhen espied on the judicial robe, Ginsburg's collars startle the eye a little; they seem incongruous. This is because the traditional black robe inhabits a realm quite far away from both femininity and fashion. Somber, unadorned, and voluminous enough to obscure nearly the entire body, the American judicial robe -- like those worn by clergy, choir singers, or graduates -- is designed to subsume the individual into the collectivity, privileging the institutional body over a specific, human one.\n\nWhen worn by a group, such as the nine Court justices, the robe merges distinct persons into a single entity consisting of seemingly disembodied heads, suggesting pure, abstracted intellect -- minds detached from bodies that have been 'disappeared'.\n\nBut those disappeared bodies were always expected to be male. The judicial robe -- a pared-down version of British court versions --was created for men. And traditionally, men do not \"wear\" their bodies the way women do; we do not focus on male physicality (at least\"straight, white, male physicality) as we do women's. According to the classic dichotomy found in many religious and philosophical traditions, men are figured as \"mind\" or \"spirit,\" while women represent the baser realms of \"body\" and \"flesh.\"\n\nRe-injecting the 'body' into judicial robes\n\nTo clothe the law in a garment that so obscures the body is not a politically neutral act. On the contrary, it carries with it the potentially dangerous assumption that bodies can be easily overlooked, that we know so well what they are, that we can move beyond them.\n\nThis risks perpetuating the traditional presumption that the justices' bodies will always be the ones we expect, the ones resembling those originally meant to wear the robe: straight, white, and male. It also implies that such bodies comprise the only subjects of the law.\n\nGinsburg's collars forestall such presumptions. By drawing attention to the specific person beneath the robe, they disrupt the amorphous collectivity of nine black-clad jurists. Her collars re-inject the concept of \"body\" into the dis-embodying judicial robe, signaling not only the presence of a woman, but by extension, the presence of a biological human body -- which demands acknowledgment and consideration.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy , Justice John Paul Stevens, Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Justice Antonin Scalia , Justice David H. Souter, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Samuel Alito. Credit: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nTo re-establish the body within the robe is a progressive political statement: Theoretical (and visual) bodiless-ness is a privilege available only to those whose bodies do not hinder them. Those with the most \"noticeable\" bodies (including women, gay people, the disabled, transgender people and people of color) are always, paradoxically, at greater risk of not being noticed by the law -- susceptible to having their needs overlooked (needs for reproductive rights, gender and marriage equality, or racial justice, for example).\n\nGinsburg's collar reminds us that the law cannot be purely abstract or disembodied -- that fairness requires it to remain attached to all bodies and their needs.\n\nAnd finally, while the collars quite specifically identify Ginsburg as an individual, they serve another purpose, too: They turn what was a generic male garment into a potentially generic female item as well, inviting future women to occupy it.\n\nUS President Barack Obama is greeted by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address on January 12, 2016. Credit: Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images\n\nThis has been literalized in cinemas screening the new documentary \"RBG\" (by Betsy West and Julie Cohen), where pasteboard silhouettes of Ginsburg's judicial robes -- complete with ornate collar -- have been set up. Moviegoers can pose for selfies in \"RBG drag,\" as if wearing the robes themselves. The implied message is clear and inclusive. It says to anyone, especially women and girls: \"Imagine yourself here! This could be you!\"\n\nOf course, men still dominate the Supreme Court, six to three, with no change in sight for the moment. And femininity in fashion -- of the sort we see in many of Ginsburg's ruffled or lacy collars -- still codes as decorative, incidental, or girlish, even though Ginsburg is a deeply formidable woman. On other women, frilly adornments -- bows, ruffles, lace, ribbons -- hardly suggest righteous power. This remains a problem -- the decorative suggests the less central, the less important, a side embellishment. Perhaps then it would be liberating to read Ginsburg's frilliness as irony, as permission (or as an invitation) to reclaim femininity in fashion for its subtle, surprisingly undermining power. Now might be the right time to proclaim the dainty lace collar the next pink pussy hat.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct when Ginsburg wore her \"dissenting\" collar.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/ruth-bader-ginsburg-collars/index.html", "published": "2018-08-20T11:22:54+00:00"}, {"title": "The future of fashion: Complex, diverse, and more vocal than ever", "text": "Fiona Sinclair Scott , CNN London Written by\n\nFew readers will recognize the woman on the cover of Business of Fashion's print edition this month. She's not a model, she's not a designer, she is not the leader of a luxury conglomerate. Kalpona Akter is a former child worker from Bangladesh.\n\nAkter, now an activist fighting for what she calls \"jobs with dignity,\" began working in a garment factory aged 12 after her father (the family's sole earner) suffered a stroke. She remembers her first day vividly -- the sound of the machines and shouting voices were frightening. On a video call from Dhaka, she recounted having \"never seen so many people in one place before.\"\n\nFast-forward a couple of years and her fear had evolved into activism. By the age of 14, she was campaigning on the factory floor. By 17, it was her bosses who were the fearful ones. They fired her for being a troublemaker and tried to get other factories to blacklist her. This move proved to be short-sighted -- on their part, at least -- as it only served to propel Akter into a far more powerful position. The 42-year-old is now the executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Worker Solidarity\n\nBy her own estimate, she represents some four million people at the bottom of the fashion supply chain -- many of them whom labor in conditions that would shock those working in the industry in New York, London, Paris or Milan.\n\nMinimum wage for garment factory workers in Bangladesh is currently around $68 per month. She is campaigning to get this up to $200 by the end of the year, while simultaneously battling issues around economic freedom for women, violence and mistreatment on the factory floor.\n\nFashion's new vanguard\n\nFashion's complex ecosystem\n\nAkter is one of four people to appear on the front cover of Business of Fashion's (BoF) cover this month, which reveals the title's annual BoF 500 list . Now in its sixth year, the list has come to serve as the definitive guide to the people shaping fashion today.\n\nAkter and her fellow cover stars provide a snapshot of where the industry is trying -- slowly, but perhaps more surely than in previous years -- to go. As a set, they attempt to offer a more accurate picture of the global fashion industry's complex ecosystem.\n\nCompleting the line-up are: Francois Henri-Pinault, CEO of Kering, a luxury group that owns brands like Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga; the young Yara Shahidi, an actress, model, activist and student in her first year at Harvard; and Virgil Abloh, the first ever black artistic director at Louis Vuitton.\n\nClockwise: Kalpona Akter, Francois Henri-Pinault, Yara Shahidi and Virgil Abloh Credit: The Business of Fashion\n\nIn a note announcing this year's cover stars, BoF founder and editor-in-chief Imran Amed described 2018 as \"harrowing,\" referencing sexual misconduct (allegations against photographers Mario Testino, Bruce Weber and Patrick Demarchelier have all surfaced this year) and ongoing gender inequality issues, as well as the conditions and pay of workers in the industry.\n\nSpeaking from his office before the list was announced, Amed admitted that the selection process was troubling this year.\n\n\"In such a difficult year, what was there to celebrate?\" he said. \"In previous years, the BoF 500 has been a huge celebration for the fashion industry. But this year, in particular, we wanted to put our lens on the people who are attacking and addressing some of these issues head on.\n\n\"And so it's a celebration, but it's a celebration of the people who are emblematic of the change that we need to see in fashion.\"\n\nThe other BoF cover stars have different, but perhaps no less pressing, concerns about the state of the industry. At the other end of the supply chain, Pinault sees an inability to look ahead as a major threat.\n\n\"The biggest risk for the luxury industry, as for many others, is short-term thinking,\" he said. \"It's good to run a flourishing business now, but what about tomorrow?\n\n\"As business leaders, we have a responsibility towards our shareholders, clients and other stakeholders -- as well as to the planet -- to consider long-term issues and to try to anticipate possible risks, even if they seem extremely hypothetical. For example, what if one day we could no longer use leather? Or cotton?\"\n\nBoF 500 veteran Alexa Chung (she was added to the list in 2013), a model who recently started her own label, has similar fears about the sustainability of fashion.\n\n\"The most pressing issue for me right now is the environmental impact of fashion on the planet,\" she wrote in an email. \"I believe we have reached a stage where companies can no longer blithely plough on doing what we do without educating ourselves about how our businesses could run in a less harmful way.\n\nAlexa Chung Credit: Alexa Chung\n\n\"We need to advocate a circular economy by informing and engaging with our customer base and encouraging them to reconsider the consumption of a garment or accessory. We should search for solutions to collect items back, for materials to be re-used, for customers to find and use platforms to re-sell their used garments... the list goes on.\"\n\nBut the problems facing the fashion industry are vast and complex. Action that furthers one cause -- such as reducing consumption -- may hinder another. When asked about the messages she wanted people to hear the loudest right now, Akter said: \"Keep buying clothes!\"\n\nAfter the Rana Plaza disaster five years ago -- where more than 1,000 workers lost their lives after a nine-story factory building collapsed suddenly in Dhaka -- it's easy to understand how consumers might feel conflicted. Should they stop buying clothes made in Bangladesh? No, said Akter. Her message is to buy responsibly, and to demand more from brands. In her opinion, the power of the consumers' collective voice must be deployed.\n\nVisibility, voice and sustained positive change\n\nThere are countless other challenges for the industry to address. Racism, unconscious bias and the use of fur and other animal-made materials are just some of the issues at play. It's also widely believed within the fashion world that we can expect more painful revelations to contribute to the #MeToo movement. So back to Amed's question: What is there to celebrate?\n\nVisibility. The fact that Akter features on one of BoF's covers is powerful, as is the notable number of non-white cover stars featured across major fashion magazines, from Vogue to Elle, this September (a fashion magazine's September issue is traditionally regarded as the most important of the year).\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's cover shoot for American Vogue's September issue was shot photographer Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a cover for the title. Credit: Tyler Mitchell\n\nVirgil Abloh's outlook is also gently uplifting. The 37-year-old Ghanaian-American certainly has reason to be positive about the year so far: In June, he presented his debut collection for Louis Vuitton (aptly titled \"We Are the World\"), having been named the brand's artistic director of menswear in March.\n\n\"I'm an eternal optimist,\" said Abloh during a phone interview on the day his cover was announced. \"A lot of the things we didn't believe were possible, in terms of access, design and voice, proved to be possible this year.\"\n\nAbloh, a trained architect, practicing artist and creative director of his own label, Off-White, is the first black designer to hold such a position at the French fashion house. His appointment was another promising step towards greater diversity and inclusion within the industry, and his debut post-show runway walk, in the gardens of the Palais Royal in Paris, had everyone in attendance on their feet. Some -- including Abloh himself -- were visibly overcome with emotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 On June 21, Virgil Abloh showed his first collection as artistic director of Louis Vuitton menswear. Credit: Peter White/Getty Images\n\nThe drive for diversity stretches beyond race. At 3 feet 5 inches tall, Sinead Burke, who recently became a contributing editor at Vogue, joins the BoF 500 list for the first time.\n\nFrom a young age, Burke saw how powerful fashion could be, in terms of building confidence and empowerment. But she consistently felt left out. In order to address the difficulties faced by disabled people who want to engage with fashion, Burke advocates for the inclusion of more voices. In her opinion, the solution is not to \"design for\" but to \"design with.\"\n\n\"When we're trying to build solutions to the challenges that exist within product, or within architecture, or fashion, often the assumption is that those in power still have all the solutions,\" she said during an interview in London. \"But actually what we really need is collaboration. (We need to bring) those who are most affected, who have lived the experience, to the table.\"\n\nSinead Burke Credit: Tim Walker/The Business of Fashion\n\nAbloh, seems determinedly focused on youth. His most pressing issue is giving more young creative people a voice. He wants to see more people trained and supported so that they can help \"modernize the system.\"\n\nThis year's BoF 500 list appears to reflect a similar sentiment, with less of a focus on established talent, and more emphasis on the \"new vanguard,\" as Amed put it. Three scientists are included on this yea's list (Ingvar Helgason, Andras Forgacs and Dan Widmaeir), recognized for using technology to find solutions to fashion's sustainability issues. Musician Troye Sivan also made the cut. The 23-year-old singer-song-writer has become a Gen Z queer icon, talking openly about gay sex in his latest single \"Bloom.\"\n\nMuch like Abloh's outlook, the list -- and the atmosphere around it -- feels cautiously hopeful. If 2018 was a year of ups and downs, a year of reckoning, perhaps the next 12 months will be defined by increased visibility and inclusion, more demand for accountability from business owners, and a sustained trajectory of positive change.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/bof-500-2018-future-of-fashion/index.html", "published": "2018-09-10T07:34:31+00:00"}, {"title": "Brazil's National Museum: A museum is gone and might never return", "text": "Written by M\u00e9rcio Gomes, CNN\n\nM\u00e9rcio Gomes is a Brazilian anthropologist living in Rio de Janeiro.

And everyone feels part of the larger cultural mechanism that has produced an attitude of carelessness and a basic incapability to keep an institution like the National Museum in a state of good repair.\n\nWe Brazilians have lost much of the material memory of our short past. A good part of our 518 years of history -- or that which had been transformed into storable objects and could be seen by all -- disappeared in just a few hours.\n\nPerhaps we can, in a decade or so, reconstruct the museum and reconstitute part of its collections of scientific objects, memorabilia and curios to once again entertain the children who flocked to see them.

Instead, Liu has given us something to think about.\n\nAn early rendering of the Serpentine Pavilion Beijing, designed by Jiakun Architects. The pavilion is a stone's throw from the Forbidden City. Credit: Jiakun Architects\n\nWe should have expected no less. The Chinese architect, now in his 60s, is rarely prone to showmanship, his stern demeanor only occasionally betrayed by a wry, playful streak. His previous work offers moments of sublime beauty: the play of water, concrete and light in his Luyeyuan Buddhist Sculpture Museum in Chengdu, the city which he's based, or the monumental, sun-dappled staircase of his Suzhou Imperial Kiln Museum\n\nBut mostly, Liu is known as an architect with the common touch. He unapologetically describes his work as \"low-tech,\" letting inexpensive materials and basic construction techniques speak for themselves.\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The temporary pavilion will be open to the public from May 30 to October 31, 2018. Credit: WF Central\n\n\"His projects engage with a local context, connecting Chinese public life and urban cultural space,\" said the Serpentine's artistic director, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in an e-mail.\n\nLiu's buildings may be clever and impressive, but they are never pretentious. His style is often described as a form of architectural \"realism.\" And as we near the tenth anniversary of the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, his approach stands in stark contrast to an event that announced China's return as a global power.\n\nCentered on the Bird's Nest stadium, that dazzling tangle of steel by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron and the now dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei (how times have changed), the Games served as a glaring reminder of architecture's power to represent and even shape a new epoch.\n\nBut as the Olympic fireworks lit up the Beijing sky, Liu was in Sichuan province where, just three months earlier, the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake had devastated the countryside and killed almost 90,000 people . He and his studio aided recovery efforts by inventing a system that quickly turned rubble into usable bricks (Liu called them \" Rebirth Bricks \") while constructing an achingly humble memorial to a rural schoolgirl who had perished in the tragedy.\n\nShifting attitudes\n\nA stone's throw from the Forbidden City, Liu's Serpentine Pavilion Beijing is almost perfectly aligned with the Bird's Nest along the capital's historically significant north-south axis. But the two structures are separated by more than just the decade between them -- they represent a shift in architectural priorities as well.\n\nEven the most perfunctory glance at China's ever-expanding skylines offers enough evidence that the architecture of spectacle, with its kaleidoscopic contortions and gravity-defying acrobatics, is still in fashion. But beneath it all, the spotlight has pivoted towards approaches more rooted in Chinese culture.\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing. The pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow. Credit: Jiakun Architects\n\nOften small-scale and made using local materials, this is the architecture long practiced by Liu and the Pritzker Prize-winning Wang Shu , and increasingly by younger cohorts like Zhang Lei, Zhang Ke, and Xu Tiantian. Encouraged by everything from growing cultural self-assurance to government policies promoting rural development, their work is now emerging at the fore.\n\n\"He's the right architect at the right time,\" the Serpentine Gallery's CEO, Yana Peel, said of Liu in a phone interview.\n\nAccording to Liu, his pavilion reflects the Confucian concept of \"junzi,\" a kind of morally cultivated self, as expressed in the metaphor of an archer's bow.\n\n\"I wanted it to give a sense of inner strength,\" he said by phone of the structure, which gently curves upwards at either end and is paved with the type of floor tiles once used in the Forbidden City. \"It's like an archer standing firm without firing a shot. It's pure force, but how you handle that force reflects your cultural attitude.\"\n\nPut another way, Liu's pavilion aims to reveal architecture at its most essential -- a visceral embodiment of potential energy held in elegant tension. But it's difficult not to also see, in the strain of its tightly-drawn posture, something more ominous about the growing controls over many aspects of Chinese life coming from the seat of power nearby (the Communist Party's headquarters stand adjacent to the Forbidden City).\n\nSerpentine Pavilion Beijing 2018 designed by Jiakun Architects, WF Central, Beijing.

Teenage models clomp between fittings and makeup stations in preparation for what will be a very tense 15 minutes.\n\nAmid it all, Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren, the Dutch designers behind Viktor & Rolf, move through the fray with unexpected calm, given the occasion. This season's haute couture show, just hours away, is the apex of a year of celebration as the designers mark their brand's 25th anniversary.\n\nViktor Horsting, left and Rolf Snoeren backstage at their 25th anniversary show at Le Trianon theater in Paris on July 4, 2018. Credit: Suzanne Plunkett for CNN\n\nHorsting and Snoeren, one of fashion's most outrageous odd couples, have been champions of the avant garde from the beginning. Since meeting as 19-year-olds at the Arnhem Academy of Art and Design in the Netherlands, they've aspired to design clothes that are more curious than commercial, spawning countless conversations about the separation of art and fashion with collections that straddle both.\n\nTheir menswear, womenswear and haute couture have earned them industry praise and patronage from the likes of Bjork, Madonna, Lady Gaga and Tilda Swinton, with the latter inspiring and walking in the pair's Autumn-Winter 2003 ready-to-wear show.\n\nAfter revisiting their archives for \"Viktor & Rolf: Fashion Artists 25 Years,\" an exhibition at the Kunsthal Rotterdam museum, and \"Viktor & Rolf: Cover to Cover,\" an upcoming coffee table book, the designers have mined the past again for the runway. This latest show has seen them recreate 25 of their most iconic pieces in white, embellishing them with more than half a million Swarovski crystals.\n\nTailors take a break while putting the finishing touches on a creation backstage. Credit: Suzanne Plunkett for CNN\n\n\"We've always cherished the work we did in the past. That's just part of who we are,\" says Snoeren. \"We wanted it to not be nostalgic. We wanted it to be a light-hearted, fun, celebratory way of looking at the past.\"\n\nBut for those who have followed the brand, it's hard not to get pangs of nostalgia looking through the garments hanging from metal rails around us. The final selection is a retrospective of the weird and wonderful: One gown appears to be sewn from a duvet and pillows (Autumn-Winter 2005), while another seems to have had a cannonball knocked through its tulle skirts (Spring-Summer 2010). A painted dress from Viktor & Rolf's aptly titled \"Wearable Art\" collection (Haute Couture Autumn-Winter 2015) transforms into a hangable canvas when taken off the wearer.\n\n\"We had to really show the codes of the work we've done,\" Snoeren says. \"And it's interesting to see how timeless, in a way, the pieces are and how they connect because you can't really tell when each piece was made. Somehow, they've become a new unit -- in our eyes at least.\"\n\nA model's dress, a recreation from Autumn-Winter 2005 ready-to-wear collection, is adjusted backstage before the show. Credit: Suzanne Plunkett for CNN\n\nSuch impractical concepts reflect the kind of creative independence that many designers dream of but few can afford. It is all made possible by Viktor & Rolf's business model, which uses profits from licensing and its wildly popular fragrance empire (which started with 2005's Flowerbomb) to fund more creative endeavors.\n\n\"I think at a certain moment, the success of our perfume business ... changed things for us,\" Horsting says. \"We realized how important it is to put creativity at the forefront, and it (also) gave us more freedom to do that.\"\n\nIn 2008, Viktor & Rolf became a subsidiary of Only the Brave (the Renzo Rosso-owned company that backs Maison Margiela, Marni and Diesel) and in 2015, Horsting and Snoeren surprised many when they announced they were discontinuing their ready-to-wear lines.\n\nAt the time, Russo told Women's Wear Daily the decision was \"a strategic decision to position the Viktor & Rolf brand in the highest luxury segment of fashion.\" But Horsting and Snoeren were also relieved to excuse themselves from a system they'd become disillusioned with, burdened by expectations around trendiness, wearability and commercial viability. They returned their focus to couture (they showed couture for two years from 1998, and returned to the schedule in 2013) and have recently branched out into bridal and occasionwear.\n\n\"We find it difficult to work in the (ready-to-wear) system -- the pace, the industrial system itself -- even if we worked with great partners. We just had a really hard time finding our groove there. I don't know how else to say it. We tried a lot of different ways, but I don't know. It wasn't us,\" Snoeren says.\n\nAt the rarefied world of Paris Couture Week, it's fantasies, not clothes, that are most in demand. Historically, this has been Viktor & Rolf's specialty. In Autumn-Winter 1999's \"Russian Doll\" couture show, for example, the designers showed an entire collection on one model, Maggie Rizer, personally dressing her in layer after layer on the runway. And in their Spring-Summer 2001 show, tap dancers in Louise Brooks-style wigs were drafted in to wear the clothes. (Horsting and Snoeren, wearing matching white suits, joined in on the final number.)\n\nA model presents a creation during the Viktor & Rolf 25th Anniversary catwalk show. Credit: Suzanne Plunkett for CNN\n\nHorsting explains that runway concepts often come first, \"and then the clothes are almost actors in a play.\" But today, they've decided to minimize the element of performance: \"We really wanted to focus on those moments, so we didn't want any distractions.\"\n\nIndeed, when the show finally begins (30 minutes behind schedule), the models walk through rows of chairs on black carpet, which is sprinkled with Swarovski crystals, with minimal fanfare. The clothes -- a Bowie-esque catsuit of mesh and glitter, a trench coat with the giant word \"NO\" protruding from the collar -- take the spotlight.\n\nWhen the models line up on the stage for the finale in front of a twinkling curtain of gold lights, and dramatic music swells throughout the theater, it seems a fittingly spectacular climax.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/viktor-rolf-25-anniversary-haute-couture/index.html", "published": "2018-07-10T09:58:31+00:00"}, {"title": "Meet North Korea's art dealer to the West", "text": "Written by Hannah Ritchie, CNN Pontassieve, Italy Contributors Muhammad Darwish\n\nIn a sleepy town in Tuscany, over 8,000 kilometers from Pyongyang, you can find one of the West's largest collections of North Korean art. The man behind the operation, Pier Luigi Cecioni, has been bringing North Korean artworks to Pontassieve -- a small commune just a stone's throw from Florence -- for over 10 years.\n\nThe pieces in his collection all come from the same Pyongyang art studio, Mansudae. With an estimated 4,000 employees, it is the largest state-run art house in North Korea -- and one of the largest art production centers in the world.\n\nCecioni formed his working relationship with Mansudae back in 2005, when, during an official tour of the country with an Italian orchestra, he asked to look at some North Korean art.\n\nMansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings.\n\n\"Once I was there, I said, 'I'm actually very interested in art -- do you have anything to show me?'\" Cecioni said in his studio. \"They brought me to Mansudae's studio. Nobody had ever heard of it (in) the West, so I asked them whether they would they be interested in doing some business in the West, and they said 'sure.'\"\n\nWith over 1.2 million square feet of studio space, Mansudae produces an array of artworks, including woodcuts, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, embroideries and even jeweled paintings made from semi-precious stones. Cecioni sells them all, with prices ranging from $300 to $7,000, depending on the size and detail of the work.\n\nThe best-sellers, he explained, have been hand-painted propaganda posters, which are the most affordable and have proven popular with art collectors.\n\nCecioni sells works from Mansudae for $300 to $7,000.\n\nCecioni said that dealing with the state-run art house has proven to be surprisingly easy. \"Doing business with North Korea is, in a way, very old fashioned,\" he said. \"They're very trustworthy. What they say, they do. And what you say, you have to do.\"\n\nHow Cecioni imports the artworks -- some of which are over two meters wide -- is similarly straightforward: \"There is DHL in Pyongyang. So they are sent through DHL to us, and they arrive in five days,\" he said.\n\nSanctions taking effect\n\nBeyond the world of art collectors, Mansudae is best known for large bronze statues, which can be found in African countries such as Namibia and Senegal.\n\nThe sale of these socialist-style statues has, however, come under scrutiny from the United Nations, which last year blacklisted the studio as part of tightening sanctions against Kim Jong Un's regime. It is believed that the monuments were being paid for in cash or land, helping North Korea evade existing sanctions and take in millions of dollars in income.\n\nCecioni imports artworks from Pyongyang using DHL.\n\n\"This money is highly significant,\" the coordinator of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, Hugh Griffiths, told CNN in December 2017. \"We are looking at at least 14 African (UN) member states where Mansudae alone was running quite large construction operations.\"\n\nCecioni only deals in two-dimensional art, claiming that Mansudae's statue business is separate from the studio's main operation -- despite being run under the same name.\n\n\"It's like a big art company, there are many branches,\" he said. \"The money they received from us essentially goes back into running the studio. The very large statues -- that's Mansudae, but it's so different from the other things they do. It's definitely a multi-million-dollar enterprise, so I'm sure there is some direction from the (state).\"\n\nCecioni said last year's UN sanctions has affected his business, as he's no longer able to import North Korean art.\n\nDespite Cecioni's convictions that the art he buys plays no significant role in generating income for the regime, his business was still impacted by last year's UN sanctions.\n\n\"The sanctions that are on Mansudae specifically -- I think they were not well placed,\" he said. \"I don't think they had the right perception of what Mansudae really is. They aimed at the statues, and they also hit the things we do, which are irrelevant for the economy of the country.\"\n\nCecioni's ability to acquire new works has come to a sudden halt. \"The sanctions on my business have had a tremendous effect, because we cannot import anymore,\" he said.\n\nBest-sellers, according to Cecioni, have been hand-painted propaganda posters.\n\nBut while the Italian is not bringing in any new artworks, he still has over 300 pieces in storage. Demand from international customers hasn't slowed, he said.\n\nBut instead of selling from his existing stockpile, Cecioni has begun rejecting sales, saying that the art has always been difficult to accurately value, and that he wants to keep the works he has on hand until he can start importing again.\n\n\"We are not really trying to sell anymore,\" he said, \"because we cannot replenish our inventory.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/north-korea-art-dealer-pier-luigi-cecioni/index.html", "published": "2018-05-07T02:30:19+00:00"}, {"title": "Norman Foster: Why Osvaldo Borsani was a design pioneer", "text": "Written by Norman Foster\n\nNorman Foster is a world-renowned English architect. He heads the international firm Foster and Partners and won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1999. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.\n\nOsvaldo Borsani was a true innovator. Born in 1911, the architect, designer and visionary left his mark at a crucial time in Italy's design history. From the 1930s he started working with other creative luminaries like Lucio Fontana, Roberto Crippa, Aligi Sassu, Fausto Melotti, and Arnaldo Pomodoro.\n\nIn 1943 he completed his own Villa Borsani in the town of Varedo, near Milan, still beautifully preserved as it has always remained with the family. Along with the extensive archives housed on its grounds, it offers a rare insight into his richly layered modernism. In 1953, along with his twin brother Fulgenzio, he founded his own manufacturing company, called Tecno -- a project for which he worked his whole life.\n\nA portrait of Osvaldo Borsani.\n\nMy introduction to the world of Tecno was in 1983 when Marco Fantoni, the son-in-law of its founder, Osvaldo Borsani, visited our London studio. At the time I was working on the Headquarter tower for HSBC in Hong Kong and Marco was offering the services of Tecno for the interior fitout.\n\nAlthough the idea of a collaboration on the Hong Kong Bank was never realized, Marco later proposed a commission to develop a new range of furniture for Tecno. This was not the first such approach by a furniture manufacturer. Alias, also in ltaly, and Knoll in the United States, had made similar overtures but for a variety of reasons they did not feel right. Whether it was the chemistry of the personal relationships or my research into the company and its background -- whatever the reasons -- I felt confident enough to take Marco's idea forward.\n\nAn interior view of Villa Borsani in Varedo, near Milan. Credit: Courtesy Tecno\n\nTwin brothers\n\nI eventually made a visit to Tecno's facility at Varedo, a fifteen-kilometer drive from the center of Milan. There I met the founder -- Osvaldo Borsani with his brother Fulgenzio. lt seemed to be the essence of a successful close-knit family enterprise that had prospered on a commitment to design and innovation.\n\nVisiting this flagship on my trip it was difficult to believe that it had been realized almost thirty years earlier in 1955, shortly after the launch of Borsani's design classic, the P40 lounge chair.\n\nMeeting the team within this building was to find an extraordinary cross-section of the Borsani family. One of the most challenging aspects of any design enterprise is how to balance the opposing forces of creativity and the commercial imperative. The Borsani bothers resolved this conflict by Osvaldo being the creative force and Fulgenzio taking care of the business side.\n\nTheir respective children, Valeria and Paolo, were very active in the company and with, Marco Fantoni and Robert Timosci formed the inner circle for our collaboration. This was the manner in which the so-called Nomos (from the Greek for 'law of custom') table and a related workplace systems of furniture was to evolve. In 1987, the design won the coveted Compasso d'Oro ADI Award.\n\nVilla Borsani will be open to the public during Milan's Salone del Mobile. Credit: Courtesy Tecno\n\nDesigning an exhibition\n\nThe public launch of the Norman Foster Foundation in Madrid in June 2017 was an opportunity to show the Foundation archive and the Fantoni family were surprised to find such a wealth of material on Nomos and its evolution -- apparently lacking in their own archive ABV based in the family's original Villa Borsani in Varedo. lt transpired that they were planning an exhibition that would chart the life and times of Osvaldo Borsani, the story of Tecno and its significant projects.\n\nGiven the importance of Nomos in any such narrative, it is perhaps hardly surprising that within the space of a few days the two Foundations had decided to collaborate on the exhibition with a request from Tommaso that the project team within the Norman Foster Foundation should lead on the design of the exhibition.\n\nVilla Borsani was completed in 1945. Credit: Courtesy Tecno\n\nFor me it has proved to be an opportunity to explore the life and times of a talented individual and the remarkable company that he created. Although the Nomos range is physically small, on the scale of the epic architectural projects which have engaged me over the years, it has a special personal significance, not just because it was my first involvement in product design for industry, but it was a manifesto for the importance of the furnishings within a building.\n\nThe central theme of a timeline is well established in the exhibition and will enable the visitor to walk through the different periods in the work of this not so well known but significant design pioneer and along the way to find insights into the wider process of design.\n\nDissolving barriers\n\nOsvaldo Borsani spanned the custom design of a range of individual pieces which could change their shapes kinetically across to the systems thinking of large scale furniture installations for commerce.\n\nAn exterior view of the Villa. Credit: Courtesy Tecno\n\nPart of the mission of my Foundation is to encourage the links between architecture, design and the arts -- to demonstrate the importance of dissolving barriers -- especially between industry and design.\n\nWhen I described the way in which the Nomos products had evolved under the large modular roof of the Varedo factory, I remember Borsani present at many of the key visits, as a figure in the background, elegantly dressed in tie, white shirt, cardigan and jacket. He did more than engage with us and approve the project. He was responsible for an environment in which it was possible to do what we did. He had created and cultivated an attitude of mind which encouraged craftsmanship and an attention to detail and quality. These were instilled across a relatively small workforce but they ran deep and had been nurtured over decades.\n\nThere are several parallel themes running through this exhibition but for me one of the most important is the nobility and pride in the human touch that lies behind the making of something well.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/norman-foster-on-osvaldo-borsani/index.html", "published": "2018-04-16T15:00:12+00:00"}, {"title": "David Hockney at 80: An encounter with the world's most popular artist", "text": "David Hockney's home studio is set deep in the Hollywood Hills. We drive there from Sunset Boulevard, past sweeping views of the canyon below, 1920s Art Deco homes and modernist glass boxes perched at intervals on the hillside.\n\nThe \"English Angelino,\" as he sometimes refers to himself, lives in a corner house off the main road, just where the hill flattens out. A verdant, anonymous compound behind high gray fences, it's quiet, with no through traffic. With only a four-figure number on the door and a buzzer, there is no hint that this has, since 1979, been home to one of the world's most recognizable and popular artists.\n\nWe are buzzed in and directed up a short path to Hockney's studio, a building set aside from his home. From here, it is hard to make out his actual house, which is apparently a series of one- and two-story buildings -- bungalows almost -- enveloped in plants and shrubs. There are steps down, and somewhere tantalizingly out of sight is Hockney's famous swimming pool, a recurring subject in his paintings.\n\nDavid Hockney at 80: A rare encounter with the artist\n\nThe studio -- a long, white, airy space with a staircase leading up to a gallery -- is a converted paddle tennis court. Upon entering, we see half a dozen or so works in progress. Hockney is preparing for a show at Pace Gallery in New York in April.\n\nWe hear him before we see him -- his hacking smoker's cough, to be precise. At 80 (and a half), Hockney is sitting in a favorite comfy armchair, reading the Financial Times. He peers up inquisitively through owlish glasses, before struggling up to greet us. He's wearing a blue and green striped cardigan (familiar to me from recent photos) and paint-spattered trousers, his once vibrantly dyed blonde hair now gray and thinning. He clutches a cigarette packet in one hand.\n\nI'm little nervous at the beginning and don't want the interview to start before the cameras are ready to roll. We've arrived with three cameras to capture Hockney's every gesture, every laugh and every cigarette drag (he smokes three or four cigarettes during the interview).\n\n\u201c I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years ... Every day I've done what I want to do. \u201d David Hockney\n\nMaking polite conversation, his assistant J.P. asks where I'm staying. I name a new boutique hotel on Sunset that he hasn't heard of. I complain about the lighting design in my room, which was so moodily dim that I couldn't find the bedside light switches. Evidently no one reads in bed these days -- the dominant fixture is a giant TV.\n\nHockney quickly interjects: \"Yes, they are just big voids,\" he says, referring to the TV screens. \"I don't like voids.\"\n\nPainting the pool\n\nHockney says that his swimming pool was also looking \"a bit like a void,\" so in the summer, the day before his 80th birthday, he had it drained so he could repaint the bottom himself with arcs of blue.\n\n\"Once it was painted, it made you see all the plants,\" he says. The job took him two and half hours, \"and that's how long it took me 20 years ago.\"\n\nHockney's ex-lover, Gregory Evans, who lives next door and runs the business side of things for him, apparently questioned whether he was up to the job. \"Of course, I thought I could do it,\" he says a little defiantly.\n\nHe admits that he is stubborn, and you can sense a fierce willpower. He is not happy with the shade of blue -- it's \"a bit too pale\" -- and he may do it again. An hour or so later, after the interview is over, I politely ask if we can film his swimming pool. No, says Hockney -- \"Gregory wouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" (1972) by David Hockney Credit: Art Gallery of New South Wales/Jenni Carter\n\nA bigger retrospective\n\nThe pretext for our visit is Hockney's 80th birthday retrospective, which has already drawn well over a million visitors to London's Tate Britain, the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\n\"I realize it is the last time (a retrospective) will be done in my lifetime,\" says Hockney. And that's the truth of it.\n\nI ask him how this retrospective compares with the one in 1988 (around the time of his 50th birthday). \"Well,\" comes the blunt reply, \"it's 30 years later, 30 years more painting. A big difference, 30 years.\"\n\nWe both laugh and I blush a little with embarrassment. It's arguably a stupid question, but there is also a feeling that Hockney wants his later work to receive the same attention that his paintings from the 1960s and 70s did.\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy\" (1970-1971) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\n\u201c I think in painting you can do things you can't do in photography. Edvard Munch said photography can't compete with painting because it can't deal with heaven or hell. \u201d David Hockney\n\n\"Christopher Isherwood and Don Bachardy\" (1968) by David Hockney Credit: Tate, David Lambert and Rod Tidnam\n\nThroughout the interview Hockney is his usual chatty, funny, contrary, bee-in-his-bonnet self. Naturally, he mentions smoking more than once -- \"Sixty-five years ago. I began smoking and they were called 'coffin nails' then.\"\n\nHis father had been \"a big anti-smoker but (he died from) eating chocolate biscuits at 75. I'm five years older than him now,\" he says with a certain relish.\n\nFish and chips\n\nHaving first achieved success in his early 20s, Hockney has long been financially comfortable. But it seems that money never mattered that much to him, providing he has enough to run his studios.\n\nHe has always been generous by nature. I mention an early lithograph he gave away in 1954 -- the interior of a Yorkshire fish and chip shop with a 17-year-old art student, elbow on the counter, patiently waiting for his food to arrive.\n\n\"Yes I remember it. I remember drawing it on a lithographic stone they had at the art school in Bradford (in West Yorkshire).\"\n\nHockney has astonishing recall. There were only \"about five copies,\" he says. I tell him that the copy that he gave to the shop's owners recently sold at auction for just under \u00a319,000 ($27,000). Hockney shrugs; he's not remotely bothered. He's well aware that his work has risen hugely in value.\n\n\"My Parents\" (1977) by David Hockney Credit: Met\n\nOne of the first people to acquire Hockney's art was his friend and fellow student at London's Royal College of Art, the late R.B. Kitaj, in the early 1960s. Kitaj paid \u00a35 ($7) for a drawing of a skeleton. \"That was quite a lot of money then,\" Hockney says, recalling being pleased that he was then able to buy cigarettes in packs of 20 rather than 10.\n\nHockney holds on to much of his own work, and has set up a foundation to look after it. I mention how much I admire his drawings of his mother, who died age 99 in 1999 (he painted her virtually every time he visited her). Hockney hints that he may exhibit them one day.\n\nA gay pioneer\n\nHockney recalls the royal photographer, Cecil Beaton , purchasing one of his more sexually explicit paintings, \"Adhesiveness,\" for less than $60.\n\n\"I remember delivering it to his house,\" he tells me. \"He had it for 40 years.\" The money helped pay for Hockney's first visit to New York in 1961.\n\nWe sometimes forget that, as a gay man in the public eye, Hockney was a pioneer of sorts -- an artist too honest not to paint his desires. Fresh out of college, he celebrated his sexuality through his work at a time when gay sex was still outlawed in England (it wasn't legalized until 1967). Those early pictures \"look rather good and stand up,\" he says.\n\n\"Man in Shower in Beverly Hills\" (1964) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\n\"Domestic Scene Los Angeles\" (1963) by David Hockney Credit: Private collection\n\n'I feel 30 in the studio'\n\nIt's difficult to imagine Hockney not working. His work ethic is utterly engrained.\n\nHockney likes to paint in silence, \"to look, and look again.\" Unlike Lucian Freud, for whom Hockney sat for a portrait for a total of 120 hours, he doesn't talk much to his sitters. Freud, he says, was \"amusing, gossipy and bitchy about other artists.\"\n\nHockney laughs but doesn't elaborate. Both artists attended royal lunches as members of the Order of Merit, and he confides that Freud was always better at conversing with the Queen, as they had a common interest in horse racing.\n\nHanging by the studio staircase is Hockney's design for a six-meter (20 feet) high stained-glass window honoring the Queen, which is set to be unveiled in Westminster Abbey in October (we are quickly told that we can't film it). Suffice to say, it shows nature at her most glorious.\n\nThe image was drawn from memory on an iPad and features a favorite subject, hawthorn blossom. Hockney was obviously inspired by his prolonged stay in Yorkshire (2005-2013) where, year after year, he painted the seasons en plein air. A composite photo shows how it will appear once it's installed by the Abbey's transept. It looks splendid, enlivening an august religious space.\n\nEvery day, Hockney paints for six or seven hours. \"I'm perfectly happy doing this,\" he says. \"I feel 30 when I'm in the studio, so I come in every day and work, because then I feel 30.\"\n\nArtist David Hockney in his Bayswater studio Credit: Francis Goodman/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nDavid Hockney's eyes are matched for color during a sitting for his waxwork for Madame Tussaud's Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHockney never seems to stop thinking about work. He takes iPad images of his current paintings to bed, so he can look at them and know \"what to do straight away\" the next morning. Painting is Hockney's be-all and end-all.\n\nOur interview is regularly punctuated by his smoker's laugh, a guttural infectious chuckle. But he also seems older and more fragile, perhaps a tacit awareness of mortality. More than ever, he is reluctant to leave his studio -- his refuge, his cave.\n\nHe doesn't want to walk far or go to restaurants where he can't hear anything (he has got progressively deafer in recent years, and wears hearing aids in both ears). He is less and less keen on flying, disliking both long flights and travelling alone.\n\n\"Travelling, I feel 80,\" he says poignantly.\n\nA bigger book\n\nFor almost the first time in his life, Hockney has begun looking back at his work in its entirety to reflect on his exhilarating artistic journey. Implicit in our conversation is the sense of an artist reflecting on his place in art history. And his undeniable conclusion is: \"Yes, I've made a few memorable pictures. I know that now.\"\n\nA crucial moment in this self-reflection has been the release of \"A Bigger Book,\" a 77-pound \"sumo\" book published in 2016. It is, he acknowledges, his autobiography.\n\n\"Well, I realized,\" says Hockney, flipping through the pages, \"that this would last 100 years. Most people will see my work in this book. So why not make it good?\"\n\n\"A Bigger Splash\" (1967) by David Hockney Credit: Tate\n\nHis own copy -- which comes on a bespoke stand designed by Marc Newson -- is within easy reach, a few feet from his armchair. \"I keep looking through it,' he admits.\n\n\"I think I've not done so bad in my life for the last 64 years,\" he muses. \"Every day I've done what I want to do.\"\n\n\"That's a privilege', I say. \"I know I'm privileged,\" comes the reply, \"I've always known that I was privileged.\"\n\nHanging on the wall, just by the studio entrance, is a framed handwritten note. It was pressed into Hockney's hand by a stranger while he was visiting a museum. It reads: \"Thank you for brightening our world.\"\n\n\"That was OK, wasn't it?\" he asks rather sweetly at the end of the interview. \"Yes,\" I exclaim, \"more than OK. Thank you!\" And it's true. Hockney has been in fine fettle -- funny and characteristically open, two of the many reasons why he has been so admired and loved for so long.\n\nOn camera, the years seemed to fall away. He sparkles and looks momentarily boyish. Before we wind our way back down the Hollywood Hills, he signs my Hockney book for me -- \"with love, David and a kiss\" -- and sees us out with a gentle handshake.\n\nCNN's Francesca Church, Oliver Dann, Ana Rosado, Emir Eralp, Aaron Darveniza and Fiona Sinclair Scott contributed to this story.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/david-hockney-at-80-interview-los-angeles/index.html", "published": "2018-02-07T08:43:02+00:00"}, {"title": "Sky-rise living: Palace or prison?", "text": "Sam Jacob Written by\n\nSam Jacob is director of Sam Jacob Studio for architecture and design, a professor of architecture at the University of Illinois at Chicago and visiting professor at Yale School of Architecture.

An urban miasma of homes and inns punctured by an incredible amount of spires that point toward the sky.\n\nIt is an image of a city whose horizontal horizon contained the hustle and bustle of worldly life while its vertical dimension was dedicated to higher ideals.\n\nPrio to the Great Fire London, the capital was a jumbled low-rise city.

Towers were structures that performed special roles: symbolic, monumental, even mythological. They acted as symbols of power, of godliness, or in the case of the biblical story of Babel, overreaching ambition.\n\nIt was only at the beginning of the 20th century that the earthly world of human life began to occupy the sky. And it happened in Chicago, where a new phenomenon of towers emerged in the super flat landscape of the American Midwest. As the city's size and population exploded at the turn of that century the technologies of construction combined with supreme Chicagoan pragmatism to invent the modern typology of the skyscraper.\n\nThe Home Insurance Building, Chicago, 1926.The building was demolished in 1931.

Others followed fast, and the Chicago School, as it came to be known, developed a new typology that combined modernity with decoration and ornament.\n\nThe Monadnock building on the left, photographed from a neighboring skyscraper in 1895.

Other examples included the Monadnock Building (the largest commercial build in the world at the time of its construction in 1892), the Reliance Building (famed for developing large plate glass windows), and the Marquette Building (with its intricately patterned terracotta exterior). Each of these helped develop the skyscraper typology.\n\nEnabled by technology, these new commercial American buildings were also a function of economics. Building high meant developers could multiply plots of land vertically, stacking floor upon floor to multiply value again and again. It meant that the kinds of speculation familiar to the stock exchanges of Chicago and New York could be applied to the act of building.\n\nThe Reliance building, Chicago. Credit: Chicago History Museum / Contributor\n\nIn Europe, architects eyed the possibilities of high-rise differently. Instead of commercial value, early modernists saw how a different kind of social value could be created. Advances in technology, they hoped, could be harnessed to create a more equitable social good.\n\nThe Marquette building, Chicago (built in 1895).

Symbolically, these towers of the welfare state offered something new, something modern with light and air that represented an escape from the grimy industrial city of the past, liberation from the old order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 10 \u2013 Ping An Finance Center, Shenzhen, China 2017's tallest new skyscraper was the 1,966-foot (599-meter) Ping An Finance Center in Shenzhen, which is now the fourth tallest building in the world.\n\n\n\nClick through for more towers completed in 2017.

We see the new luxury developments, super high-rises built as high-end homes -- or more often investment opportunities. Just as old London's skyline reflected the aspirations and ideas of its age, we see silhouettes that reflect ours.\n\nAnd amongst them, the charred shell of the Grenfell Tower, after a tragic fire in 2017 killed at least 71. It stands as a totem signifying the battle over the right to the city that has characterized recent years. As social housing has been increasingly privatized and funding squeezed, we have seen the boom in other kinds of high-rises for business and for the wealthy. It has led to a schizophrenic state where there are calls to demolish all of the tall post-war housing stock while at the same time accelerating high-end luxury living.\n\nThe remains of Grenfell Tower are seen from a neighbouring tower block on June 26, 2017 in London. Credit: Carl Court/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nOutside of the big 'P' politics of the situation, towers still seem to contain those very same ancient Babylonian dreams and fears. Highness brings with it a separation from the city below. For some, towers mean power and success or a kind of quiet beauty, while others see alienation from the street and arrogant elevation above. Somehow the pragmatism of vertically stacking still carries echoes of those early significances, as if contemporary buildings can't shake old superstitions. On the one hand places full of the light of aspiration, on the other hubris and the moral peril as if defying the laws of gravity is somehow an overreaching of the normal social or economic order too.\n\nIt's strange that the tower, such a new phenomenon relatively speaking, has so quickly become typecast -- as if we've exhausted our imagination of the possibilities of vertical life. Perhaps it's appropriate that -- back in its birthplace -- the tower as a speculative possibility was the centerpiece of this year's Chicago Architecture Biennial . In an exhibit titled \"The Vertical City,\" artistic directors Sharon Johnston and Mark Lee invited over 15 emerging architecture practices to reinterpret the tower as a building type through giant-sized five meter tall models.\n\n\"(Not) Another Tower\" by Tatiana Bilbao (2017) Credit: Tom Harris\n\nTatiana Bilbao's \"(Not) Another Tower\" suggested how the technology of vertical buildings might become a framework to allowing for a more ad-hoc community to become a kind of civic collage in the sky. Office KGDVS proposed a kind-of ultimate vertical multiplication project where their 'ideal' building type of the palazzo was placed one on top of another, each layer larger than the last so that it formed an inverted spire. Serie Architects reimagined the possibilities of the structural frame to built a tower of nested tables to create bigger and smaller floor plates, one sometimes within the other. K\u00e9r\u00e9 Architecture's big blue tubes punctured with holes suggested a more optimistic idea of the Tower of Babel, where all kinds of life; living, working and leisure could all be part of the same structure.\n\n\"Chicago Pasticcio\" by Sam Jacob Studio (2017). Credit: Tom Harris/Chicago Architectual Biennial\n\nMy own firm -- Sam Jacob Studio -- imagined how a high-rise building might be formed out of stacking sections of very different kinds of buildings one onto of another so that rather than repeating the floor plate, a whole host of different types of spaces and uses might be possible.\n\nIn other words, these propositions showed that there are many ways to reimagine the tower beyond its current state. To reinvigorate the possibilities of vertical building with the same energy that was the source of its original invention -- as both an economic and social possibility.\n\nAfter the Great Fire of London in 1666, the city was rebuilt. As part of the new city, 51 new churches were built, including a series of churches by Christopher Wren's assistant Nicholas Hawksmoor, each with strange and striking towers. Among them, Christchurch Spitalfields with its obelisk on top of a triumphal arch, St Anne's Limehouse, which seems crowned by series of turrets supported by a mass of intersecting columns, and St Georges Bloomsbury with a ziggurat placed above a temple.\n\nIf we need to look anywhere for inspiration for the next generation of towers (and surely, we do, looking at what's being erected around the world right now) then there would be nowhere better to look.\n\nThese spires must have seemed unfeasibly tall and shockingly modern in their day. Yet they're rich and intriguing contributions to the city, explorations of our collective aspirations and fears, full of diversity and imagination that suggest new ways that me might live together. Could we not imagine towers today that could take on the same kind of role?", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/skyrise-living-sam-jacob/index.html", "published": "2018-01-11T12:12:37+00:00"}, {"title": "Is art for pleasure or politics?", "text": "Written by Michael Govan\n\nMichael Govan is the director and CEO of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). On March 28, he chairs an Intelligence Squared discussion with four contemporary artists on the topic: Is art for pleasure or politics? The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nHenri Matisse famously declared that he dreamed of an art \"devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter ... a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair.\" His close friend Picasso, who more often indulged the darker sides of human emotion, wasn't especially political in his art either.\n\nNonetheless, in the mid-1930s, during an urgent rush of creativity, the latter painted a dramatic mural-sized protest over the bombing of Guernica in the direct black and white tones of a newspaper. The political directness of his \"Guernica\" (pictured above) may have been inspired by the revolutionary attitude of his Mexican friend Diego Rivera, or the politically charged paintings of his historical compatriot Francisco Goya's famous series, \"Disasters of War.\"\n\nThe painting is an obvious example of how aesthetics and protest are not mutually exclusive. Picasso showed that painter and painting could be both.\n\nA visitor examines \"La Perruche et la Sirene\" by French artist Henri Matisse at the exhibition \"De Oase van Matisse\" at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in 2015. Credit: SANDER KONING/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe art world has always debated where it falls on the spectrum between pleasure and politics. Do we really want art to challenge us with the conflicts and threats we find in the news every day?\n\nIf it does so, contemporary political art risks preaching to an audience comprised of a small, well-educated liberal elite that is already aligned with its message. Arguably, this art will then become complicit in feeding on the same market and power structures whose hands it bites.\n\nIs it unfortunate that a few high-profile transgressive images can spoil a government's appetite for art that might be described as simply beautiful, inspiring or educational? Maybe. Or maybe not. Are Ai Weiwei's artistic provocations a threat -- or more like a Socratic gadfly nibbling at the state to rouse it into becoming its better self?\n\nThe responsibilities of art\n\nAt LACMA (the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where I serve as director), you'll find plenty of examples of contemporary artists addressing our political era's most pressing issues: Alej\u00e1ndro I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's new and beautiful VR installation that engenders empathy for the plight of immigrants; a huge and seductive painting by Mark Bradford that calls out the injustices perpetrated by U.S. police against African-American men; or a spectacular mural by Barbara Kruger that, if not strictly protest art, is certainly pointed in its cry for greater awareness of what a capitalist consumer culture portends.\n\n\"CARNE y ARENA\" (2017) by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. Credit: Courtesy of LACMA\n\nHaving said this, many of us gravitate toward art, or art museums, not for politics or protest, but for the type of comfort Matisse sought. We may even use art to find solace in an unstable and sometimes threatening world. The people waiting in lines outside every museum that has hosted Yayoi Kusama's recent traveling retrospective were seeking (beyond Instagram moments) pleasure and wonder in trippy, brightly-colored, literally glowing, immersive environments. And why not?\n\n\"INFINITY MIRRORED ROOM: LET'S SURVIVE TOGETHER\" (2017) by Yayoi Kusama. Credit: TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nConsider also, however, that the pursuit of pure beauty can be more political than we think. Artists are always citizens of somewhere. They are also human, and thus carry the same responsibility that most of our politics, religions and philosophies suggest: that we should improve, not diminish, our lives and the world we inhabit.\n\nThe principles of aesthetics aren't at odds with social and political responsibility. To use another example from LACMA, Chris Burden's bright and iconic \"Urban Light\" sculpture at the museum's entrance may have inspired more playful pictures on social media than any other major artwork in the world, but it has its own politics. The artist himself saw his composition of 202 historical street lamps, made a decade ago, as a statement about what constitutes a sophisticated society: \"safe after dark and beautiful to behold,\" as he put it.\n\n\"Urban Light\" (2008) by Chris Burden. Credit: Courtesy of LACMA\n\nAn ongoing debate\n\nThe art world is far from consensus on the relationship between art and politics. Indeed, the lineup of artists discussing this very topic at an Intelligence Squared event in Hong Kong this week exemplifies the diversity of opinions on how -- or even whether -- the two should interact.\n\nBoundary-defying 33-year-old Chinese artist Lu Yang mixes media and the Internet into a bold soup of topical issues, poking at social mores while declaring that her work has nothing to do with politics.

In more than one of her artworks she has combined the human breath, through voice -- of Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Sufism -- poetically insisting that we are one humanity and spiritual whole.\n\nGreat art has, through time, been made in many guises.

The opinions in this article belong to the author.\n\nTwenty-nine years ago, a group of anonymous feminist artists known as the Guerrilla Girls unveiled a poster that read, \"Do women have to be naked to get into the Met.

Less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art Sections are women, but 85% of the nudes are female.\"\n\nThis week, Sotheby's is auctioning 89 works under the title \"Erotic: Passion & Desire.\" Fifty-five of the artists are men. Three are women: Marlene Dumas, Tracey Emin and Lisa Yuskavage. As I scrolled through the hodgepodge of offerings, however, I noticed one female nude after the other in traditionally passive, receptive poses, many of which are no different from countless nudes that hang on the walls of museums all over the world but are not identified as erotic art.\n\nThe venerable auction house explains: \"Whether it is to compel, to shock or seduce, these artworks remain one of the central subjects of art history while intimately charting the socio-political developments of our many cultures -- both old and new.\"\n\nI am fascinated by this reference to \"socio-political developments.\" At this particular socio-political moment, a moment of both #MeToo and the exposure of flagrant misogyny, Sotheby's auctions erotic art mostly made by white men. Although this certainly tells us about the socio-political realities of the art world and its ongoing marginalization of female artists and artists of color, what \"developments\" are being intimately charted?\n\n\"Young Lady Laying on a Bed\" (1771) by Hugues Taraval Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nArguably, lot 74, a copy of the first issue of Playboy, offers us a peek into 1950s white America, just as lot 56, the seated Colima figure with a huge penis, tells us something about fertility ceremonies in pre-Columbian West Mexico.\n\n\"Pre-Columbian sculpture will be paired with Picasso works on paper; masters of photography from Man Ray to Mapplethorpe will be set off against 19th-century marbles and antique reliefs; in turn creating juxtapositions that will enliven and deepen collectors' understanding of the subject matter,\" Sotheby's writes. Notice the evasive language. The word \"sex\" is not mentioned.\n\nIn an age when every 12-year-old has access to pornography online, when every possible sexual taste is there to be ogled, Sotheby's wants to stress that it is not selling pictures as aids to masturbation. This is erotic art. The difference is crucial. Porn is a low, crude, cheap, bodily business, not about to \"deepen collectors' understanding.\" Art, on the other hand, even when it depicts unbridled orgiastic activities, is high, intellectual, cultured, and expensive. As such, it can be related to refined mental activity or \"understanding.\"\n\nWhether buying a French 18th-century canvas by Hugues Taraval with the title, \"Young Lady Laying on a Bed\"; a Mel Ramos naked babe mounting a cigar; or a wild George Grosz drawing of two excited women and a man with a penis proportionally as big as the Colima figure's, potential collectors can feel reassured that however titillating the \"subject matter,\" the work comes stamped with Sotheby's seal of approval as high art.\n\n\"Orgie (Orgy)\" (1940) by George Grosz Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nThe boundary between erotic art and pornography has always been troubled, but ever since the Greeks, the mind, culture, and thinking itself have been identified as masculine in the West, while the body, nature, and emotion have been identified as feminine. This hierarchy is still in place. As Lynda Nead points out in her book \"The Female Nude: Art, Obscenity and Sexuality\" : \"The representation of the female body within the forms and frames of high art is a metaphor for the value and significance of art generally. It symbolizes the transformation of the base matter of nature into the elevated forms of culture and the spirit.\"\n\nThis creative transformation is the business of the male artist. As a culture, we are still struggling with what it means to be artist and woman. After all, we masculinize and feminize human activities all the time. The hard sciences are masculine and cerebral; the arts are soft and feminine. And because the arts are broadly coded as feminine, and erotic art in particular evokes the lower sensations and emotions, it becomes all the more important to give it a high, mental, masculine stamp. Although they are homoerotic, Robert Mapplethorpe's static, classical photographs of cropped male, often black, bodies fit nicely into the idea that art is the metamorphosis of brute nature into ideal, perfect forms. The naked becomes the nude.\n\n\"Antinous\" (1987) by Robert Mapplethorpe Credit: Courtesy Sotheby's\n\nIt is no secret that buying art is a matter of prestige. The act of acquiring a canvas or sculpture or photograph and paying good money for it means that you admire what you have purchased, that having the name Picasso in your house is a form of self-enhancement. Ownership signifies that the owner looks up to the talent, the brilliance, the authority of the artist.\n\nMost heterosexual men, either consciously or unconsciously, are still deeply uncomfortable with the idea of looking up to a work that has a woman's name on it. To be succinct: the male collector who buys works by women risks feeling emasculated. This is true, despite the fact that distinguishing a woman's artwork from a man's (including the offerings by women in this auction) is often impossible.\n\nThe Sotheby's sale is taking place at the same time as a Carolee Schneemann retrospective at New York's MoMA PS1. Schneemann, who is 78, has been making confrontational, sexual, feminist art since the 1960s. She often used her own body as the vehicle of representation in performance and film.\n\n\"The female nude is part of a revered tradition, although she is not to take authority over depictions of her nudity,\" she told the Guardian in 2014. \"She is just to be available.\"\n\nSchneemann, along with many others, has taken that authority. This act is most definitely \"a socio-political development.\"", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/siri-hustvedt-erotic-art-sothebys/index.html", "published": "2018-02-14T13:01:16+00:00"}, {"title": "How artists interpret war", "text": "Written by Joanna Bourke\n\nJoanna Bourke is a professor of history at Birkbeck, University of London, and the editor of \"War and Art: A Visual History of Modern Conflict.\" The following is an edited excerpt taken from her introduction. Opinions in this piece belong to the author.\n\nWar is the most destructive activity known to humanity. Its purpose is to use violence to compel opponents to submit and surrender.In order to understand it, artists have, throughout history, blended colors, textures and patterns to depict wartime ideologies, practices, values and symbols. Their work investigates not only artistic responses to war, but the meaning of violence itself.\n\nFrontline participants in war have even carved art from the flotsam of battle -- bullets, shell casings and bones -- often producing unsettling accounts of the calamity that had overwhelmed them. Tools of cruelty have been turned into testaments of compassion and civilians have created art out of rubble.\n\nArt, according to Izeta Gradevic, director of Sarajevo-based Obala Art Centre, can be more effective than news reportage in drawing international attention to the plight of ordinary people at war.\n\n\"When you face an art form,\" she told journalist Julie Lasky, \"it is not easy to escape death.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 15 \"Siege of Paris, 1870-71\" (1884) by Ernest Meissonier. The French artist's battle paintings were often referred to in Napoleonic propaganda. Credit: Muse\u00e9 D'Orsay, Paris\n\nArt in difficult times\n\nThe declaration of war typically triggers practical difficulties for artists. At the very least, the sense of crisis risks relegating the arts to a minor role in society.\n\nAs Charles C. Ingram, acting president of New York's National Academy of Design, complained in 1861, the \"Great Rebellion\" (American Civil War) had \"startled society from its propriety, and war and politics now occupy every mind.\" He lamented that \"no one thinks of the arts\" and even artists had set aside \"the palette and pencil, to shoulder the musket.\"\n\nThe state appropriation of space sees exhibition possibilities plummeting. Economic sanctions severely limit the availability of supplies. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, for example, Japanese artists faced restrictions not only of paint, but of materials such as silk, gold and mineral pigments that had been used to create \"nihonga,\" traditional Japanese-style paintings.\n\n\"The Nameless Ones, 1914\" (1916) by Albin Egger-Lienz. Painted during World War I, the artwork depicts advancing figures so bowed-down that their bodies almost blend with the earth beneath them. Credit: Heeresgeschichtliches Museum, Vienna\n\nBut everything from excitable patriotism to down-to-earth curiosity has led millions of artists into the heart of darkness. Some were official appointees, sent by their governments to create a record of what was happening or to offer visual slogans to aid morale. Voluntarily engaging in active war service could allow artists to circumvent some of the restrictions created in wartime. In fact, governments often proved willing to support artists who threw themselves into the war effort.\n\nAs the New York literary journal The Knickerbocker extolled at the start of the American Civil War, \"ARTISTS! ... remember that your elegant brushes are recording the history of a nation.\"\n\nThis required artists to serve the interests of the collective, however. Many struggled to resolve the tension between artistic freedom and censorship. Was their art supposed to bolster recruitment or demonize the enemy? Were they expected to be \"official war artists\" (as British artists were called during the First World War) or \"official recorders\" (as they were renamed during the first Gulf War)?\n\nEven the most message-orientated artist might find that they had little control over the way their images were used. They returned from the front lines to discover that their sketches had been altered or even brazenly distorted by publishers and propagandists.\n\nArt as propaganda\n\nWas it the job of artists to reconcile people to war? German artist Otto Dix thought not. His painting \"Trench\" is a searing indictment of the inhumanity of war, but critics were appalled. In the K\u00f6lnische Zeitung, a popular daily newspaper in Cologne, critic Walter Schmits complained that \"Trench\" weakened \"the necessary inner war-readiness of the people\" and offered people \"no moral or artistic gain.\" Museums are \"for art ... not propaganda,\" he insisted.\n\nTwo men hang a portrait by Otto Dix at an exhibition of \"degenerate\" German art at the New Burlington Galleries, London in 1938. The exhibition featured work by artists who had been pilloried by Adolf Hitler. Credit: Topical Press Agency/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nBut many artists embraced their role as propagandists. Miyamoto Saburo's \" Meeting of Generals Yamashita and Percival \" is a powerful example. The painting shows negotiations between Japanese and British generals during the surrender in Singapore, one of the most humiliating defeats in the history of the British army. In contrast to the forceful presence of General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the commander of the forces of the British Commonwealth (Lieutenant General Arthur Percival) is portrayed as cowardly and arrogant.\n\nThe painting won Japan's Imperial Art Academy Prize in 1943 but, more importantly, it was hoped that it would bolster morale at a difficult point in the war. The tradition of sensoga (or Japanese war painting) was awkward for those who sought to depict the horrors of conflict. Artists became embroiled in controversy when they exhibited more brutal representations.\n\nIn 1943, for example, Tsuguharu Fujita exhibited \"Desperate Struggle of a Unit in New Guinea,\" which depicts a fierce battle scene based on the defeat of Captain Yasuda's troops in 1942. Drawn in muddy browns, there are no clear distinctions between combatants on either side. War hurts. Everyone.\n\nAlthough military commentators praised the realism of the work, even using it to encourage kamikaze pilots, others were disparaging. Ishii Hakutei, one of the founders of the sosaku hanga (\"creative prints\") movement, doubted that the painting would be \"useful . . . in drumming up war spirit.\" There was \"a danger that the viewer will sense evil before admiring the loyalty and bravery of the imperial troops.\"\n\nThe realities of war\n\nAttempting to capture and convey the visceral horrors of the vulnerable body at war has taken many different forms. It has also been the focus of a very different genre of war art: medical illustration.\n\nSketches and photography made during conflict have been employed in diagnosing pathologies, aiding surgical practices and assessing the progress of a disease and its treatment. But there is also an artistic tradition in war medicine that emphasizes its artistic merits as much as its medical usefulness.\n\nWatercolour of a wounded soldier (1815) by Charles Bell.

His sketches and paintings were intended to illustrate wounds and operative techniques in order to educate other surgeons.\n\nHis emphasis on gestures was intended not only to reveal physical suffering, but to excite sympathy in observers. In his words, while the public were viewing the battle at Waterloo in terms of \"enterprise and valor,\" in his sketches he sought to remind people of \"the most shocking sights of woe\"\n\nFor Bell, visual representations of agony were crucial if the public was to both understand the realities of war and sympathize with its victims. It took great courage, as well as grit, for artists like Bell to look closely at the wounds of war and use their artistic portraits to reflect on violence and corporeality.\n\nChanging attitudes\n\n\"Siege of Paris, 1870--71\" (1884) by Ernest Meissonier. The French artist's battle paintings were often referred to in Napoleonic propaganda. Credit: Muse\u00e9 D'Orsay, Paris\n\nThe theme and mood of war art has undergone major shifts over the past two centuries. Prior to the twentieth century, war artists were more likely to depict heroic tales rich in religious imagery, such as the \"Massacre of the Innocents\" and the \"Passion of Christ.\" Nineteenth-century British painting reveled in depicting decisive military maneuvers taking place in sumptuous battlefield landscapes.\n\nIn France, artists such as Nicolas-Toussaint Charlet, Jacques-Louis David, Auguste Raffet and Antoine-Jean Gros were inspired by the deeds of Bonaparte and his army. Perhaps the most powerful of these is Gros' \"Napol\u00e9on on the Battlefield of Eylau,\" exhibited at the Salon in 1808. It shows Napoleon visiting the corpse-strewn battlefield in Eylau (eastern Prussia) the day after the bloody French victory over the Prussians.\n\n\"Napol\u00e9on on the Battlefield of Eylau\" (1808) by Antoine-Jean Gros. In France, artists like Gros were inspired by the deeds of Napoleon and his army. This painting shows Napoleon visiting the corpse-strewn battlefield in Eylau (eastern Prussia) the day after the bloody French victory over the Prussians.

While Marshal Joachim Murat is portrayed as a callous warrior, Napoleon is depicted as a compassionate, even Christ-like figure, blessing the men on the battlefield.\n\nEven at this stage, though, opposition to the heroic tradition was growing. As the Crimean War dragged on and reports of strategic mistakes proliferated, artists began expressing a general sense of disgruntlement. They began shifting their sympathy away from portraits of great generals.\n\nAs with Lady Butler's art, the true heroes were increasingly the ordinary soldier and his family. Joseph Noel Paton's \" Home \" (1856) was an important turning point. Its sentimental depiction of a wounded corporal in the Scots Fusilier Guards returning to his wife and mother proved comforting to a population ravaged by war and anxious about its aftermath.\n\nPaton did not rest content with reassuring representations of the war, however. His \" The Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Crimea, and staff, \" painted a year before \"Home,\" was damning. It depicted British officer FitzRoy Somerset as Death riding a skeletal horse over the corpses of his own men. Famine, Disease and Death stalk the land.\n\nAdmittedly, Paton did not exhibit this sketch at the time. It was first exhibited in 1871, by which time artistic dissent was more established. War artists were turning sour.\n\nArtistic bitterness escalated during World War I. The bloodbath at the Battle of Passchendaele was decisive for young artists such as Paul Nash. In an angry letter to his wife Margaret, he explained that the war was \"unspeakable, godless, hopeless.\" Its horrors were so great that he no longer considered himself to be \"an artist interested and curious,\" but was instead a \"messenger who will bring back word from the men who are fighting to those who want the war to go on forever.\"\n\nSuch artist-messengers, like their counterparts in literature, developed a narrative -- what the literary scholar Samuel Hynes called the great \"myth of war\" -- that began with \"innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honor, Glory and England\" and ended with disillusionment.\n\nFrom World War II henceforth, a new, acrid kind of art was required. Representing the \"authentic\" combat experience entailed assaulting the senses of sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch. It required artists to visually represent the sound of grenades detonating, the stench of high explosives, the metallic taste of blood, and the sight of human bone, muscle, tissue, skin, hair and fat strewn around.\n\nTo paraphrase the essayist Elaine Scarry, \"to see pain in war art is to have certainty -- to see heroics is to have doubt.\"\n\n\"The Standard Bearer\" (1934--6) by Hubert Lanzinger.

Army Center of Military History, Washington, dc (photoushmm)\n\nIntrinsically political\n\nArno Breker, often referred to as \"Hitler's favorite sculptor,\" once declared that art \"has nothing to do with politics ... for good art is above politics.\" He was wrong. Art is intrinsically political. It is often explicitly so, most obviously for artists who use their creative talents to protest against warmongering.\n\nIt is often explicitly so, most obviously for artists who use their creative talents to protest against warmongering. Even artists who explicitly seek to change the way people understand armed conflict can find that their art actually obfuscates atrocity. Art can turn violence into a tempting melodrama or consumable drama; \"war as hell\" is beguiling.\n\nBut even when not explicitly depicting the human body in its abject or mortal states, war art involves the cultural contemplation of violence. The victors and the defeated, the landscapes in which they moved, and imagined pasts, presents and futures are refracted through the creative energies of artists. The dead also live on in the hand of the artist and the eye of the witness.\n\nLoss is there for all to see.

But, like her surreal portraits, Kahlo's appearance was layered, heavy with meaning and intention.\n\nA proud \"mestiza\" -- a mixed-race woman, born to a German-Hungarian father and a half Spanish, half indigenous Tehuana mother -- Kahlo purposely mixed Western fashions with traditional garb, using her clothes to craft another kind of self-portrait. Through her dress, she constructed an ethnic and political identity that spoke of the same duality found in her paintings, and sent a highly political statement of cultural identity, nationalism, and feminism.\n\nFrida Kahlo poses outside her home and studio in Mexico City circa 1940. Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n\"(Frida Kahlo) created her distinctive style as a blend of traditional Mexican and European fashion, combined with the fundamental effects of her disabilities and her political beliefs: Kahlo as a bohemian artist, a Tehuana, a hybrid persona,\" said Circe Henestrosa, co-curator of \"Frida: Making Her Self Up,\" a new exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nAnd yet since Kahlo's death in 1954, this element of her dress has been lost, whitewashed by corporate and creativity entities looking to make her more accessible. It's this sanitization that Henestrosa and Claire Wilcox, her co-curator, are aiming to fight back against. With a display of 200 personal artifacts and items of clothing belonging to Kahlo -- silk skirts with floral embroidery, Revlon eyebrow pencils, Guatemalan coats, cotton huipils (loose tunics) -- they explore how Kahlo used her dress as both adornment and metaphor and brought Mexican identity politics to the world stage.\n\n\"('Frida: Making Her Self Up') is recapturing this lost message, a person and her beliefs, visually expressed through dress, which was the starting point of my research,\" Henestrosa explained. \"We aim to provide a personal, political and cultural context for Kahlo's story.\"\n\nFrida Kahlo with husband Diego Rivera circa 1945. Credit: Wallace Marly/Archive Photos/Getty Images\n\nGrowing up in a Westernized, upper-middle-class family, Kahlo had few traditional garments in her closet. However, despite her privileged upbringing, Kahlo was a vocal leftist, joining the socialist party when she was 16, and the Mexican Communist Party in her early twenties. For years she even claimed she born in 1910, the year the Mexican Revolution started, and was, as such a \"daughter of the Revolution.\"\n\nAs a young adult, Kahlo surrounding herself with the freethinkers, socialists and intellectuals of Mexico City, with whom a growing appreciation precolonial Mexican heritage was on the rise. Among them was the famed Mexican muralist Diego Rivera , who would become her husband in 1929.\n\nA fellow communist and supporter of the revolution, Rivera often created political murals that attacked the ruling class and capitalism, elevating Mexico's native heritage and anti-colonial efforts instead. So when he suggested Kahlo begin wearing traditional clothing as a show of Mexican pride, she embraced the idea wholeheartedly.\n\n\"Kahlo and Rivera shared a romanticized attachment to indigenous people, as did so many of the radical left at this time. The matriarchal society of the Tehuanas held a particular appeal for Kahlo, who was building her own image as an outsider: independent, but faithful to tradition, while at the same time embracing a modern, liberated lifestyle,\" Henestrosa said.\n\n\"Themes of female empowerment would be directly incorporated into her artwork through her self-portrayal in the style of the Isthmus (of Tehuantepec) women.\"\n\nTo Kahlo, her dress was just another way to perform the beliefs she espoused through her political affiliations. She would mix her contemporary dresses with Huipil blouses with Mayan roots, where each pattern told the story of the wearer, for example, and showcase her mixed heritage by combining colonial silver earrings with indigenous necklaces of jadeite and onyx.\n\nWomen wearing native dresses in Tehuantepec, Mexico in 1952.

First introduced by the Spanish colonizers during Christopher Columbus' time -- only to be reworked by the Aztec villages with their traditional embroidery and eye-popping dyes, the rebozo was also worn by the women of the Mexican Revolution during the 1910s, when they were popular among the \"adelitas,\" female revolutionaries, who used the scarves to smuggle guns past government checkpoints, helping to oust a 35-year dictatorship. The accessory soon became a symbol of Mexico's fight for freedom, and by wearing the scarf, Kahlo was honoring both pre-colonial and post-revolution women alike.\n\n\"The rebozo is a piece that evolved during the colonial period to become a symbol of femininity and, after independence, nationhood,\" Henestrosa said.\n\nA group of rebel women and girls wearing traditional dress practice their shooting skills for the Mexican Revolution in 1911.

And every time she was photographed or her name made the front page, she brought the rich history of Mexico with her.\n\nThe fashion community in particular was rapt. In 1937 she brought the rebozo to the American masses when she was featured in a Vogue article titled \"Senoras of Mexico,\" and in 1938, Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli based \"La Robe de Madame Rivera\" (\"Mrs. Rivera's Dress\") on the painter's iconic Tehuana costume featuring intricate red floral beading down the shirtfront, bringing Mexico's traditions to fashion's most exclusive circles.\n\n\"Frida Kahlo on a Bench\" (1938) by Nickolas Muray Credit: Courtesy Nickolas Muray Photo Archives/The Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection of 20th Century Mexican Art and The Verge\n\nBut as her iconic look became ubiquitous, it began to lose its meaning. After her death, without her present to give voice to her politics, her image has been reduced to the superficial: a dress is just a dress, a scarf, just a scarf. This isn't only disrespectful to Kahlo's memory, but dangerous for her legacy.\n\nIn an essay written for the \"Frida Kahlo: Making Herself Up\" catalog, art historian and cultural theorist Oriana Baddeley pointedly summarized the issue: \"In Kahlo's case, there is the constant danger that the woman, not the artist becomes the focus of audience attention. Halloween costumes can evoke the appearance of Frida but not the artistic language of Kahlo,\" she writes.\n\n\"The cartoon characteristics of Fridamania so easily become parody obscuring the intelligence underpinning the work of one of the 20th century's great artists.

They were, after all, abundant, completely free and believed to be unsinkable. Crazy as it sounded, the project was approved by British prime minister Winston Churchill himself.\n\nA prototype was built and tested at the lake over four months -- and parts of it remain there, 50 feet below the surface. The ice has long melted, but Project Habbakuk still lives.\n\nStrategic material\n\nIn 1942, at a branch of the British War Office, an eccentric scientist named Geoffrey Pyke was trying to figure out how to protect Allied ships in the \"U-boat alley,\" an area of the Atlantic Ocean where Nazi submarines, out of the range of Allied warplanes, ruled the day. With building materials like steel in short supply, he thought, why not take a chunk of ice from the Arctic and tow it south to land planes on it?\n\nGerman U-boats being chased off the US coast in 1942. Credit: Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\n\"Pyke was a sort of holdover from the last Victorian boffins, someone we'd never take seriously now because he didn't have multiple degrees. But he did have credibility,\" Susan Langley , a professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland who's done doctoral research on the subject, said in a phone interview.\n\nAt the time, ice was considered almost indestructible: the International Ice Patrol , established to destroy icebergs after one had sunk the Titanic in 1912, had reported that blowing them up wasn't easy, even with torpedoes and incendiary bombs.\n\n\"Pyke thought ice was the new strategic material that would win the war,\" Langley said. \"And Churchill was willing to entertain the idea.\"\n\nHe decided to call the ambitious design HMS Habbakuk, a misspelling of the name of prophet Habakkuk, who, in the Old Testament, wrote: \"...be utterly amazed, for I am going to do something in your days that you would not believe, even if you were told.\"\n\nThe largest warship ever\n\nBuilding a warship out of ice was just as hard as it sounds. \"One problem was that if you wanted to launch aircraft off of something, it had to have 50 feet of freeboard above the water, but because icebergs are 90% submerged, that meant having almost 500 feet below the water,\" said Langley.\n\nSuch a vessel would be almost impossible to move. Also, when the tip of an iceberg melts, it makes it turn and roll, which would be a problem with aircraft trying to refuel on it. Finally, a flight deck of some other material was required for planes to land and take off.\n\n\"So they decided to have a hull of ice, but build it like a conventional ship, which meant it had to be kept frozen through some kind of refrigeration system.\"\n\nThe proposed warship would be the largest ever built: 2,000 feet long and 200 feet wide -- more than twice as big as the Titanic -- with a weight of over 2 million tons and enough space for 300 aircraft. It would sail the seas at a speed of 7 knots (8 miles per hour) and withstand waves of 50 feet, giving Churchill his secret weapon against the U-boats.\n\nHe approved the project on Dec. 4, 1942 with a memo that was classified as \"Most secret,\" and asked for a prototype to be built.\n\n'Mad wild schemes'\n\nBritain now needed ice, so it turned to Canada for help. The experiment was assigned to the National Research Council, and the man in charge, C.J. MacKenzie, called the design \"another of those mad wild schemes.\"\n\nHe chose Lake Patricia in the Jasper National Park in Alberta as the test site due to the availability of an ironic source of free labor nearby: a camp of conscientious objectors. \"They were never told what it was. They called it 'Noah's Ark.' They knew it was something for the war effort, but they didn't know what exactly,\" said Langley.\n\nIn early 1943, a 60-foot long prototype vessel was built with walls and floors of wood, tar, refrigeration pipes and a massive chunk of ice from the lake. \"It was like a big shoe box, with a giant ice cube in the middle and the refrigeration piping running around it like a rib cage. Frozen into the middle of the ice was a smaller rectangle, where the refrigeration unit was,\" said Langley.\n\nA view of Patricia Lake, in the Jasper National Park, Canada. Credit: Education Images/Universal Images Group Editorial/UIG via Getty Images\n\nA roof was put on top of the structure to protect it from the elements and disguise it as a boat house.\n\nIt worked, but it wasn't all smooth sailing. Some of the piping arrived damaged, so water couldn't be used for the cooling system and air was pumped through instead. There were doubts about the strength of the ice and the viability of the structure itself; although a better building material called \"pykrete\" (from Pyke and concrete) was developed around this time by adding wood pulp to the ice mix, it wasn't used in the prototype, and manufacturing it in the huge quantities needed for the Habbakuk seemed impractical.\n\nThree factors\n\nThe test had shown that the ice ship wasn't pure fantasy. But by mid-1943, the project started to sink.\n\nIts demise was a combination of three factors, according to Langley. First, Iceland could be used as a permanent base in the North Atlantic, which negated the need for floating aerodromes. Second, newer planes that could patrol for longer were introduced. And finally, the development of the centimetric radar helped track U-boats more accurately. The war was starting to turn in favor of the Allies.\n\n\"Those three things made it obsolete before it even reached fruition,\" said Langley. \"It was viable, but not at the scale that Churchill wanted and as quickly as he wanted. It was feasible to build the structure, but impractical to actually implement it.\"\n\nA 1946 artist's impression of the proposed HMS Habbakuk. Credit: Illustrated London News Ltd/Mar\n\nIn June 1943, all testing in Canada was stopped and Churchill was informed.\n\nWhat's down there?\n\nOnce the project was abandoned, the refrigeration machinery was removed and the model was just left there, before subsiding into the lake. Although most people in the area had a rough idea of what had been going on, some mystique started to grow around it.\n\nLangley, who's also an underwater archeologist, overheard a conversation in 1982 about \"an airplane made of ice\" that was still in Lake Patricia. \"I thought that was impossible, but I wanted to find out more.\"\n\nSo in 1984 she dived down to have a look. \"Good thing I had no idea what I was looking for, or I don't know what I would have thought, probably that a barge full of heating ducts or something had sunk. It was interesting, so I started getting grants to go back.\"\n\nA view of the wreckage in a 1984 underwater photo by Susan Langley.

Her work has contributed to the rise of a small influx of divers visiting the area to see for themselves.\n\nThe wreckage sits on a diagonal, with the deepest corner at the 100-foot depth. It's not the easiest of dives, because the lake is at a 4000-foot altitude in the Rockies, so there's an increased risk of decompression sickness. Visibility is low and it's fairly dark all the time, not to mention an algae bloom in the summer. To help identify the wreckage, an underwater commemorative plaque was installed in 1988 in its proximity.\n\nA commemorative plaque sits underwater near the wreckage.

It dates back to 1962, and is the result of collaboration between JFK and Raymond Loewy, one of the fathers of industrial design.\n\nBut after more than five decades and eleven administrations, the elegant livery is getting a makeover. President Trump said he doesn't like the current aesthetics and intends to replace the blue hue. According to the media platform Axios, the President would like to make it look \" more American .\"\n\nRegardless of Trump's vision, it's highly likely that the next presidential plane will look different as the current aircraft approach the end of their lifespan and emerging technology makes a replacement necessary.\n\nMore than One\n\nAir Force One is technically not the name of a plane, but rather the callsign used by air traffic controllers to refer to whatever aircraft is carrying the President. Popularly, though, it is the name given to the presidential plane, a modified Boeing model 747-200B, which under Air Force designation is known as a VC-25A. There are two of them, so that at least one is ready at all times. They're mostly identical except for their tail codes: SAM 28000 and SAM 29000 (SAM stands for Special Air Mission).\n\nThe callsign was adopted in 1953 , after the plane carrying President Eisenhower and a commercial airliner, both with the tail code 8610, dangerously entered the same airspace. The president's aircraft at that time was a prop plane -- a Lockheed C-121 Constellations nicknamed Columbine II -- but it was again Eisenhower who flew on the first presidential jet, a modified Boeing 707 that entered service in 1959. At that time, the planes were still full-fledged military aircraft and they sported a red, orange and black color scheme designed by the Air Force.\n\nJohn F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson descend the presdiential plane showing a pre-Loewy livery.

It entered service in October of 1962.\n\n\"It evolved from an interesting interaction between JFK, Jackie Kennedy and Raymond Loewy, who was a famed industrial designer,\" said Air Force One historian and former Smithsonian curator Von Hardesty in a phone interview.\n\nFrench-born Loewy was among the most successful designers of his time, having created such icons as the Lucky Strike pack, Coca-Cola vending machines and the Greyhound buses, and popular logos for TWA, Exxon and Shell. \"He criticized the looks of the plane that had been delegated for presidential use, which had a garish orange nose and looked too much like a military plane. He wanted something that would reflect the presidency and he thought this was an opportunity to fashion a really compelling design, which arguably he did.\"\n\nAir Force One SAM 26000, the first plane to sport the new design.

The dominant blue paint job came at JFK's request. \"The seafoam blue and silver on the lower half was a stroke of genius to make the plane seem more horizontal and sleek,\" said designer and former president of the American Institute of Graphic Arts Sean Adams in an email interview.\n\nSAM 27000 sits on the tarmac at Texas State Technical College Airport in Waco, shortly before its retirement, in 2001.

The plane spoke to an optimism, youth, and fresh approach that was perfect for the Kennedy administration,\" he added.\n\nThe typeface for the legend \"United States of America\" is Caslon, very similar to the one used in the Declaration of Independence.\n\nSpecial Air Mission (SAM) 26000 sits on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio.

That particular airplane, tail code SAM 27000, was retired in 2001 after having served seven presidents: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush.\n\nAdams isn't thrilled at the prospect of a revamp. \"Air Force One is an identity with equity. It works,\" he said. \"Why make it look like a Walmart in the sky?\"\n\nRed, white and blue\n\nDuring the Reagan administration work began on a new generation of Air Force Ones, with first lady Nancy curating the interior design. But due to a number of delays, the planes only entered service under George H. W. Bush in 1990. While almost every system was upgraded, the paint job was preserved. \"A good design brings with it a certain inertia and you really need to have a compelling reason to change it. By that point, it was so widely accepted and universally applauded that they just wanted the new 747 aircraft to have it too,\" said Harvesty.\n\nThese are the planes that are still in use today, and the Loewy design has undergone only minor amendments, due to the larger size of the 747s.\n\n\"It's faithful to the Raymond Loewy design as much as possible on a behemoth of a plane. It's hard to make a 747 look light and sophisticated, but the color, shapes, and typography do a great job. It maintains all the positives from the 1962 version. I'm especially glad that the 1980s didn't creep in on the design with mauve and almond,\" said Adams.\n\nAir Force One SAM 28000 at Tegel airport in Berlin in 2013.

They will still be 747s -- albeit a newer version, the 747-8 -- even though the aging plane is being phased out by commercial airlines.\n\n\"The reason is that the Secret Service requires, in the interest of safety, that the President should fly only on four-engine aircraft. The 747 also provides more space for the President, his key staff, and the complex communications equipment required for the president to be in touch with anyone in the world at all times,\" said aviation expert Gene Eisman in an email interview.\n\nBut most importantly, they will sport a new look : \"Air Force One is going to be incredible,\" Trump said in a CBS interview . \"It's going to be the top of the line, the top in the world. And it's going to be red, white and blue, which I think is appropriate.\"\n\nHow exactly this will play out is still unclear. It's unlikely but Trump could even decide to repaint the current planes instead of waiting for the new ones, which will only enter service by 2024 (though the President has requested that the planes be ready sooner in 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 11 This is the first flight photo of the Columbine III, the US Air Force Lockheed Super Constellation used by President Dwight D.

(Popular slogans like \"Art into Life\" and \"Art into Technology\" epitomized this way of thinking.) These artists disrupted all rules to create a new graphic order that took center stage in the posters.\n\nTo mark the centennial of Russia's October revolution, collector Susan Pack published a book of rare avant-garde Russian film posters, which she began gathering in the 1970s.\n\nFilm Posters of the Russian Avant-Garde \" assembles the best of Pack's hoard, a connoisseur's dream that includes 250 posters by 27 artists from the pre-Stalin Soviet Union -- before Stalin decreed Socialist Realism was the only authorized art form was\n\nRevolutionary art\n\nMany of the designers who jumped on the poster bandwagon came from more traditional artistic backgrounds. The Stenberg Brothers , for example, started as Constructivist sculptors and set designers, and the prolific artist Alexander Rodchenko worked in photography, architecture and industrial design.\n\n\"They montaged disparate elements, such as adding photography to lithography, and juxtaposed the action from one scene with a character from another,\" Pack writes. \"They colored human faces with vivid colors, elongated and distorted body shapes, gave animal bodies to humans and turned film credits into an integral part of the design.\"\n\nAs filmmaking established itself as an art form, so to did these posters and their designers, who often hadn't even seen the films they were advertising and worked from press kits sent from Hollywood.\n\nTheir rare works, which were only meant to be seen for a few weeks, are now grouped in a book that will keep them away from oblivion.", "link": "http://edition.cnn.com/style/article/russia-avant-garde-film-posters/index.html", "published": "2018-01-03T12:30:06+00:00"}, {"title": "CNN Style", "text": "CNN Style continued to expand as a destination for a truly global perspective on the creative industries whilst pushing the boundaries of digital and video storytelling.

It is also almost \u00a3600m over budget.\n\nAsked why he thinks he is being forced out, Sir Terry said: \"I can only assume that because HS2 is such a critically important programme and with the sense of disappointment around the performance of Crossrail, that it was considered to be too risky for a programme like HS2 to continue in my role as chairman.\"\n\nHe said he had \"mixed feelings\" - including a \"sense of responsibility or contribution to the position in terms of Crossrail\".\n\nAnd he said he was \"disappointed\" that he no longer had the opportunity to give his experience and knowledge to HS2.\n\nHe said HS2 is a \"fantastic programme that has huge potential\" - but it will be a big challenge to deliver it. But it did not have the \"same difficulties\" as completing the Crossrail work, he added.\n\nSir Terry said he was confident that Crossrail - which is funded by the Department for Transport and Transport for London - \"behaved properly\".\n\n\"Although the station build did run a little late, what most people don't realise is the rolling stock, the trains, are not a Crossrail contract, they're a Transport for London contract,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm not responsible for rolling stock and nor are any of the executives. I personally now realise that TfL were advised that this train contract was running 18 months late and they have known that for at least eight months and that to me today still feels to be the case.\"\n\nThe BBC's business correspondent Joe Miller, said Sir Terry - who first learnt about his impending dismissal via leaks to the Financial Times - had angered London's mayor Sadiq Khan over the Crossrail project.\n\nImage copyright WPA Pool Image caption Sir Terry meets the Queen, during her visit to the site of Crossrail's new Bond Street station in 2016\n\nFollowing the report in the FT, the leader of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, Manuel Cortes, said \"it was always nuts to have one person responsible for heading up both these enormous infrastructure projects.\"\n\nSir Terry started work at HS2 in August. Phase one, linking London to Birmingham, is due to open in December 2026, while the onward legs to Manchester and Leeds open by 2032-33.\n\nThe Crossrail route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was due to open in December, but will now be launched in autumn 2019 to allow more time for testing.\n\nMayor 'angry and disappointed'\n\nResponding to Sir Terry saying he has not formally heard of his dismissal, a Department for Transport spokesman said: \"We do not comment on personnel matters\"\n\nThe department added: \"The Crossrail board took the decision to delay the opening on Wednesday 29 August and informed the Secretary of State of that decision on 30 August.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Mayor of London - who has asked Transport for London (TfL) for an independent review of Crossrail's governance - said Mr Khan \"has been clear that he discussed rising cost and schedule pressures with Crossrail over the summer, including looking at the implications if these issues weren't resolved\".\n\nThey added: \"Furthermore, the mayor has been open with Government about his concerns in relation to Crossrail governance for months, given the way that it became apparent that the work remaining was much more significant than he had previously been advised\n\n\"It was not until the end of August that the mayor, TfL and the DfT were told that the opening of the central section would definitely be delayed until Autumn 2019 -

There'll be awkward office parties as well as Christmas meet-ups with friends.\n\nFood and drinks menus have to be devised and someone has to organise getting relatives round before lunch. And whatever you do don't miss the last post (it's 20 December for first class).\n\nThe pressure to create a perfect day full of Instagrammable Christmas trees, beaming family members, and delicious food can often put strain on relationships too.\n\nBefore you know where you are, a supposedly joyful time turns into something all the more stressful. So here are some tips on how to cope with some of the key stresses of the festive season.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Do NOT feel you need to compete with light displays such as Christmas at Kew\n\n\"Christmas kind of puts a magnifying glass on relationships,\" explains Denise Knowles, a counsellor for relationship support charity, Relate.\n\n\"Christmas has been sold to us as a time of family, of enjoying being together. So if our expectations are that's what it should be, and that doesn't happen, then we feel we've failed in some way.\"\n\n\"And if we fail then it's human nature to look to point the finger of blame.\"\n\nAccording to Ms Knowles, the key to a less stressful Christmas is down to mental preparation and lots of planning.\n\nAnticipate what'll happen on the day. Will Dad have one too many and doze off just as you're about to serve Christmas lunch? Will Monopoly end in tears? (Yes.)\n\nSo once it's clear where the stress is coming from, what next?\n\nIn the words of professional organiser Jules Langford: \"Cheat, shamelessly.\"\n\n\"If you have to get mince pies for the school fair, buy them from Tesco and rough them up a bit,\" she says. No one will know, or at least everyone will understand. Expecting things to be perfect is unrealistic and instead it's about prioritising, she says.\n\nFamily\n\nImage copyright BBC/Jellylegs\n\nTis the season to be... making strained conversation with distant family members.\n\nEvery family has its unique and baffling dynamics. \"But it's all about communicating,\" explains Ms Knowles. \"You don't want an elephant in the room on Christmas Day.\"\n\n\"If you've always got great Aunt Ethel sitting in the corner and she's a bit of a pain then think 'is there someone else that can take her?'\"\n\nDon't expect people to behave differently because it's Christmas. Break up the day to give people space. Go for a walk, together or separately.\n\nFor people with separated or extended families, it's best to plan far in advance: \"It's not sexy, it's not festive, but actually knowing who is going where, when, and how is important,\" says Ms Knowles.\n\nAnd if this Christmas is the first one without a significant person, for whatever reason, it's worth considering putting new rituals in place.\n\nMaking things perfect\n\nFor busy mum Rachel McPherson, from Morayshire, her high standards and desire to see those around her happy make her stressed at Christmas time.\n\n\"I say every year I'm going small and simple,\" she says. \"But I struggle to keep the nagging gremlins at bay.\n\n\"My husband is military and works away and both my children either work full-time or are in full-time education.\n\n\"I'm part-time in the NHS. So realistically it always lands on my shoulders to make everyone's Christmas great.\"\n\nJules Langford, who spends her time perfecting other people's homes, says its important to lower expectations to realistic and manageable levels.\n\n\"There's all sorts of Christmases. Don't feel like you have to have the Christmas you see on Instagram. If you're just sitting there in your PJs watching TV, that's okay too. Cut yourself a bit of slack.\"\n\nShe recommends prioritising three things you want to do this Christmas, and treat anything else as a bonus.\n\nThis helps get perspective and cut down on the guilt you feel after dropping out of your fifth carol concert of the month.\n\nRemember, she says, it's not all your responsibility. \"Make it fun. Have a little Christmas meeting. Dole all the jobs out.\"\n\nFood and shopping\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWoe betide the cook who forgets about the cousin who doesn't like sprouts. Or the uncle who \"won't eat carrots\".\n\nCatering for everyone at Christmas is hard, but Ms Knowles says the key to avoiding arguments is delegation: \"If you've got everybody coming to you it might be an idea to say 'you do the Christmas pudding, you do the crackers, you help with the dishes afterwards'.\n\n\"That way you're not going to be stomping around annoyed in the kitchen.\"\n\nIf you don't fancy the faff of cooking, go out for Christmas lunch. \"It also stops people rowing,\" says Ms Langford.\n\n\"They're not going to start a fight in public. And no one person has to feel like they've martyred themselves.\"\n\nIf Christmas food shopping is part of your festive buzz, then hit the supermarkets, but order heavy items like drinks online.\n\nMoney\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nf you want to spare your wallet (and your relationships) make a budget and stick to it. \"Come January that's the sort of thing that causes all the angst, when the credit card bill comes in,\" Ms Knowles explains.\n\nAccording to the Bank of England, households in December spend 30% more on alcohol, 20% more on food, and 80% more on books.\n\nOne way to save money and time is a family \"secret santa\" where each member of the family buys (and receives) just one gift.

In 1998, he became governor of Florida, an office he held until 2007.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nJeb Bush was apparently horrified when he first heard of his elder brother's first political campaign in Texas, in 1994, claiming they had become a \"People magazine story\".\n\nJeb has weathered family problems, including his daughter's drug abuse, and had always - back in those days, at least - shrugged off any questions about the \"big job\", saying his only concern was \"Florida, Florida, Florida\".\n\nGeorge H W's two younger sons, Neil and Marvin, have also used their family name to go into business, but, so far, have shown little desire to enter politics.\n\nElection cliffhanger\n\nInstead, in a scene worthy of the soap opera Dallas, which made his state famous, it was the Texas-based prodigal son who rode in to claim the biggest share of the Bush legacy.\n\nGeorge W's efforts to transform his life had already included giving up drink, committing himself to Christianity and family life, as well as becoming governor of Texas.\n\nIn 2000, he set his sights on emulating his father's greatest achievement.\n\nThat November, after a vote-counting cliff-hanger, George W picked up his Stetson and retraced his father's steps into the Oval Office.\n\nHis brother Jeb's state of Florida determined the outcome of the 2000 presidential race, amid allegations of impropriety and vote-rigging.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn his time at the White House, George W followed his father's example. Both men dispatched task forces to the Gulf, but where the elder Bush let Saddam Hussein escape his clutches, the younger chased him into a hole.\n\nWhen father and son spoke in turn at Reagan's funeral, seldom had one family's access and influence in Washington seemed so concrete and enduring.\n\nAnd in late 2014, the former Florida governor Jeb Bush announced he was exploring a run at the White House, immediately raising the possibility of another Bush-Clinton rematch, this time with Bill's wife, Hillary.\n\nHe was initially one of the Republican frontrunners but failed to shine and was eclipsed by Donald Trump.\n\nObservers have not failed to notice yet another Bush son coming to the political fore. Jeb's son, George Prescott Bush, first came to the public eye when his grandfather introduced him to President Reagan as \"one of the little brown ones\", referring to his half-Mexican parentage.\n\nHe dipped his toes into the political water when he became co-founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a pressure group aimed at getting more Hispanic candidates to seek political office in the state.\n\nGeorge P spoke at the National Republican Convention in 2000 and impressed viewers with his address in Spanish and English.\n\nThen in 2014 he won his first election, becoming Texas Land Commissioner, thereby sealing the reputation of the Bush dynasty as a conveyor belt of political success stories."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-46405135", "published": "2018-12-01T06:38:26", "title": "Van Morrison: New intrigue on Astral Weeks anniversary", "text": "Image caption Cyprus Avenue is one of the many corners of Belfast made famous by Van Morrison\n\nVanatics can be found across the globe.\n\nThey are the most dedicated fans of Belfast's poetic, enigmatic, musical genius.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of the release of his most critically acclaimed album -

He trained as an aviator before being assigned duties in the Pacific where he saw action against the Japanese during World War Two.\n\nJust 18, he may well have been America's youngest flying officer, assigned to pilot torpedo bombers off aircraft carriers.\n\nHe was shot down in September 1944 while on a bombing raid. His plane filled with smoke and flames swallowed both wings. \"My God,\" he recalled thinking, \"This thing's going to blow up.\"\n\nHe continued to pilot the aircraft, dropping his bombs on their target. He ordered his two fellow crew members to parachute out of the plane but neither man survived.\n\nChoking on the smoke, Bush followed his crew - smashing his head on the tail of the plane as the wind propelled him backwards.\n\nImage copyright US Navy Image caption He was picked up by a US submarine after his plane was shot down in the Pacific. 'Welcome aboard, sir,' said the torpedo man who hauled him from the water. 'Happy to be aboard,' replied the future commander-in-chief.\n\nHe made it into a tiny life-raft and began paddling away from the nearby Japanese island with his hands. Incredibly, a US submarine rose to the surface right next to him and his rescue was even captured on camera.\n\nFollowing his honourable discharge from the navy in 1945, Bush married 18-year-old Barbara Pierce. Their marriage would last 72 years and they would have six children together.\n\nTheir first son, the future president George Walker Bush, was born a year later.\n\nBush had been offered a place at Yale prior to his enlistment in the navy, and he took it up in 1945, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n\nImage copyright George Bush Presidential Library Image caption Only weeks after returning from the Pacific, Bush married Barbara Pierce. 'I married the first man I ever kissed,' the future First Lady recalled. 'When I tell my children that they just about throw up.'\n\nBush and his family then moved to Texas where, with the use of his father's business connections, he got a job in the oil industry. By the age of 40, he was a millionaire.\n\nHe and Barbara suffered the trauma of losing their first daughter to leukaemia. Robin was taken to the doctor suffering from tiredness and the awful diagnosis was completely unexpected.\n\nImage copyright Corbis Image caption Two future presidents - George H W Bush holding aloft his baby son, George junior\n\nThe family was shattered by her death a few months later. When Barbara Bush herself died, 65 years later, the family posted a touching note. \"Give Robin a hug from us, Mom,\" it said.\n\nConservatism\n\nGeorge's professional interest had turned to politics. After serving as the chairman of a local branch of the Republican Party he took a major step, seeking and winning the Republican nomination for the US Senate seat for Texas.\n\nThe Democratic incumbent successfully branded Bush as a right-wing extremist, gaining 56% of the vote to Bush's 43%. Undaunted, Bush successfully stood for the House of Representatives in 1966, where he served for two terms.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon persuaded Bush to try for the Senate again in 1970 but, again, he was defeated by the Democratic candidate. Instead, Nixon appointed him US ambassador to the United Nations in 1971 and then Republican Party chairman.\n\nWhen Nixon was forced to resign 1974, Bush did his best to heal some of the wounds left by Watergate, touring the country in support of Republican candidates. At the end of the year he went to Beijing as head of the new US mission there.\n\nImage copyright Empics Image caption As Republican National Chairman in 1973 with then Vice-president Gerald Ford\n\nAfter just over a year in China, President Gerald Ford brought him home to take charge of the Central Intelligence Agency, which had been rocked by a series of scandals relating to covert operations abroad and unauthorised spying on US citizens.\n\nThe posting coincided with a deterioration in Barbara's mental health. She wrote in her biography that she would have to pull her car up on the side of the road for fear of steering into a tree, or on-coming traffic. The dark feelings eventually passed.\n\nBush left the CIA after Ford left office and, in 1978, began campaigning for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election.\n\nHe travelled the country, preaching his brand of moderate conservatism and, by the beginning of 1980, had emerged as the main challenger to Ronald Reagan.\n\nBut he entered the presidential fray only to find that his privileged past could be a political liability.\n\n\"What's wrong with excellence?\" he said at the time. \"What's wrong with having a good education? What's wrong with having excelled in my life and business or being a good ambassador in China or the United Nations, or having done an excellent job at the CIA? I have. I know that sounds a little immodest, but that's my record.\"\n\nImage copyright Keystone/Getty images Image caption A cabinet meeting in the family quarters of the White House.

The second was in a speech Bush made at the 1988 Republican National Convention.\n\nDuring an attack on the fiscal policy of his Democratic opponent, Michael Dukakis, Bush made a pledge that was to haunt his presidency and ultimately bring about his political downfall.\n\n\"Read my lips,\" he told the assembled delegates. \"No new taxes.\"\n\nAfter one of the most acrimonious election campaigns in US history, Bush became the first serving vice-president to be elected to the top job since Martin van Buren in 1836.\n\nIt was a time of momentous change which saw the the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet empire.\n\nImage caption George H W Bush came to the presidency at a time of great global change.

Bush moved quickly to build an international coalition to end Saddam Hussein's occupation and establish a US military toehold in Saudi Arabia, a valuable strategic dividend.\n\nImage copyright VT freeze frame Image caption When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, George HW Bush faced his greatest foreign policy dilemma. When he decided to delay military action in order to get approval from the UN, Margaret Thatcher famously warned him that \"this is no time to go wobbly\".\n\nHe delayed military action in order to give time to secure UN approval for the action. The decision lead to a famous rebuke from Margaret Thatcher.\n\n'Well, all right, George, but this is no time to go wobbly,\" said the Iron Lady in a middle-of-the-night phone call from Downing Street.\n\nThe subsequent battle proved to be a triumph for American military expertise and a major boost for the nation's morale.\n\nIn the defining moment of Bush's presidency, the US and its allies swept across the desert in a ground war lasting just 100 hours.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The 1991 Gulf war was one of the biggest tests of his presidency. The ground war lasted 100 hours but Saddam Hussein remained in power\n\nThe victory boosted the president's standing despite the fact that US and allied forces stopped well short of Baghdad, allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. It would be left to the president's son to topple the Iraqi dictator.\n\nDespite achieving popularity ratings of 90%, Bush's decision to concentrate on foreign affairs led to accusations that he was ignoring the worsening economic situation at home, most notably, the longest-lasting recession since World War Two.\n\nHamstrung by a Democratic-controlled Congress, President Bush insisted that the worst was over economically.\n\n\"We are going to lift this nation out of hard times,\" he pledged, \"Inch-by-inch and day-by-day and those who would stop us had better step aside.\"\n\nBut the country would not believe him. To make matters worse he did the one thing he had promised he would never do: he raised taxes.\n\nThe 1992 election was a disaster. He was let down by a poorly run campaign and had to fight off a strong challenge from the conservative Pat Buchanan for the Republican nomination.\n\nDefeat\n\nBush could not match the energy of his opponent, the young Democratic governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, who conveyed a new vision for America that Bush admitted he simply could not express.\n\nThe image that summed it all up came on a trade trip to Japan that ended in dismal failure when the president fainted after vomiting at a banquet laid on by his hosts. Bush went down to a landslide defeat.\n\nHis later years were spent touring the world in his role as elder statesman. Though delighted to see George W Bush enter the White House, relations between the two men were said to be somewhat strained.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Relations between the two Bush presidents were said to have sometimes been strained\n\nBush celebrated his 90th birthday in June 2014 by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. But he began to make fewer public appearances and was forced to use a wheelchair after developing a form of Parkinson's which meant he could no longer use his legs.\n\nA series of women accused him of acting inappropriately towards them at various times in the past. A spokesman, Jim McGrath, acknowledged that Mr Bush had \"on occasion\u2026 patted women's rears in what he intended to be in a good-natured manner\". The former president denied groping anyone but let it be known he apologised to anyone he might have offended.\n\nHe also lost Barbara - his wartime bride - after more than seven decades of marriage. Her funeral was attended by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - although President Trump stayed away.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption George HW Bush at the funeral of his wife Barbara, surrounded by former presidents and first ladies\n\nAs president, he proved himself an efficient chief executive - more of a manager than inspiring leader.

His domestic agenda will be less well applauded - with critics complaining he came across as a somewhat confused president with a shaky grasp of economics.\n\nAnd personally, George Herbert Walker Bush will be remembered as, essentially, a cultured family man, uncomfortable with the rough and tumble of politics.\n\n\"Because you run against each other that doesn't mean you're enemies,\" he once said. \"Politics doesn't have to be uncivil and nasty.\""}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-46408375", "published": "2018-12-01T02:36:14", "title": "G20 Argentina: Saudi prince's international standing revealed", "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Few world leaders went out of their way to shake hands with the Saudi Crown Prince\n\nFor Mohammed bin Salman, the G20 summit was always going to be a test.

Some of his counterparts shared a word or two but few went out of their way to shake his hand.\n\nThey know just how toxic the Saudi leader is seen by some of their electorates. The one exception was President Putin of Russia. He bounded up to MBS and engaged in an elaborate and vigorous high five, grinning rather obviously for the cameras. The Russian leader is a past master in winding up liberal Western leaders while also nodding to his strategic need to stay close to Saudi Arabia.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Vladimir Putin and the Saudi crown prince high-five\n\nSo the optics of the summit, to use the diplomatic jargon, were not that great for MBS. And when it came to his meetings, they were equally tricky.\n\nOn one level, he was not shunned. Many leaders were ready to speak to him, both briefly and formally, including those from the US, India, South Korea, Mexico, South Africa and China. The Saudi foreign ministry tweeted out pictures of the meetings with almost indecent haste.\n\nBut the prince did not get a fair wind at all these encounters.\n\nTheresa May met him for the first time since the murder of Khashoggi and one source said she had been very direct. The Prime Minister's spokesman said she urged the crown prince to make sure Saudi Arabia co-operated fully with the Turkish investigation.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

And she said Saudi Arabia had to take action to build confidence that such a deplorable incident could not happen again. The Prime Minister also urged the Saudi leader to back political talks on the Yemen conflict expected next week.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Theresa May met the Saudi prince on the sidelines of the G20 summit\n\nPresident Macron of France also met Prince Mohamed in the margins of the summit and called for international investigators to get involved in the hunt for Khashoggi's killers. Footage of the meeting suggested that Mr Macron told MBS that he was worried and did not think the Saudi leader was listening to him.\n\nThe truth is that summit accurately reflected the Saudi crown prince's standing in the world. There remains some real anger felt by his fellow leaders by the way that Saudi Arabia - and potentially he - has behaved. And that anger has yet to dissipate while the investigation into Khashoggi's murder remains unfinished.\n\nBut at the same time, most of these leaders know that it is in their country's national interest to remain engaged with Saudi Arabia, that they have trade and intelligence relationships that need to be protected, and that it is better to keep talking rather than chucking rocks from a distance.\n\nSo at this G20 summit, there was no obvious snub, no clear signal that MBS has been placed on the global diplomatic bench kept for international pariahs.\n\nBut equally it was clear that his reputation has some way to go before it is repaired. And that will depend on how he responds once the Turkish investigation into the Khashoggi murder is complete."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46022049", "published": "2018-12-01T00:18:35", "title": "Why I wanted photographs of my husband\u2019s funeral", "text": "Image copyright Rachel Wallace Image caption The \"calm before the storm\" at Nick \"Ringo\" Southall's funeral\n\nNibs Southall often looks back at the photographs of her husband Nick's funeral, but there's one to which she always returns.\n\nIn the picture, she sees herself facing the hearse, back to the camera.

We don't have many people with that spirit.\"\n\nNeither side were able to mount any real pressure in the second half, with the draw leaving the Saints in the relegation zone in 18th with just one win in their past 15 Premier League games, including last season.\n\nMark Hughes' side will reflect on a costly capitulation at the end of the first half after fine goals from Stuart Armstrong and Cedric Soares had seemingly put them in control.\n\nUnited move seventh - still six points off a Champions League place and a massive 16 shy of the lead held by rivals Manchester City.\n\nMakeshift and make do?\n\nOn the face of it, this is a bad result for a Manchester United side harbouring hopes of a top-four finish - but it could have been worse, as a Southampton side with just one league win all season punished a sloppy opening.\n\nUnited have spent hundreds of millions of pounds under Mourinho but not for the first time this season started with a makeshift defence. Midfielders Scott McTominay and Nemanja Matic started in a back three, with Marcos Rojo only deemed fit enough for a place on the bench.\n\nMcTominay and Jones seemed to be in each other's way in the build-up to the opener, as Republic of Ireland youngster Michael Obafemi rolled the ball into Armstrong's path, and the former Celtic man drilled a fine strike across David de Gea and in.\n\nSouthampton had scored with their first attempt of the match, and added a second shortly after when Rashford made a rash challenge on the edge of the area and right-back Soares marked his 100th Premier League appearance with a first goal, brilliantly curling beyond De Gea from 20 yards.\n\nUnited looked listless, but found the inspiration they were badly lacking in Rashford. First the 21-year-old collected a long ball, bounced through a half-hearted challenge from Maya Yoshida and laid a chance on a plate for Lukaku. Even without a club goal in 12 games and nearly three months, the Belgian couldn't miss.\n\nRashford then did even better shortly afterwards, beating three defenders on a surging run into the penalty area and finding Herrera at the near post, the Spaniard providing a clever backheeled finish under Alex McCarthy.\n\nBut that was where the excitement ended for United. In a largely lifeless second half their only shot on target was a tame overhead effort from Paul Pogba, and Mourinho's already stretched squad saw Luke Shaw, Rashford and Lukaku limp off late on, while Ashley Young picked up a fifth booking of the season which rules him out of Wednesday's league game at home to Arsenal.\n\n'Rashford was a mad dog'\n\n\"I would say Marcus Rashford was a mad dog,\" Mourinho added.\n\n\"He was, let's say, very, very tired with little problems. That appetite, that desire, that fire that you have, you need that to recover the ball faster and to recover the ball higher on the pitch, but these are just details.\n\n\"He was injured, he was asking to come off. Some players with that kind of injury do not play for two weeks, but Marcus no, Marcus I am pretty sure he will be fine for the next one. It is one kick here, one kick there, one fall here, one fall there, fatigue, lots of running, lots of movement, 75 minutes and he was done.\"\n\nSaints squander another lead\n\nHughes said that he was \"really pleased\" with the point, but the former United forward has now won just three of his 21 league games in charge of the Saints, who stay in the relegation zone on nine points.\n\nThey have now squandered a league-high 12 points from winning positions this season, a statistic that could have telling consequences later on in the season.\n\nThe hosts were the better side in the second half, with the impressive Nathan Redmond forcing De Gea into a sharp save from long range, but they never really looked like forcing a much-needed winner.\n\n\"When you look at our performance and the table, we are not where we want to be. Are we under-performing compared to last year? Probably not,\" Hughes said.\n\n\"We have to get maximum points in games, everybody saw by the manner of our performance that we are a good side, we just have to keep working and performing.\"\n\nMan of the match - Marcus Rashford\n\nHe got United back on track almost single-handedly with two superb assists\n\n'Forget about the league table'\n\nManchester United midfielder Ander Herrera said: \"We should forget right now about the table, we should try to win every game. That's how we will reach the top four.\n\n\"We should approach the Arsenal game like a final.\n\n\"It's two points dropped, but apart from that we can build from what we did after they scored the second goal.\"\n\nNo home joy for Saints - the stats\n\nSouthampton remain the only team in the Premier League yet to win a home game this season (D5 L2).\n\nMark Hughes has won just three of his past 25 Premier League games as a manager in the competition (W3 D9 L13).\n\nCedric Soares is the seventh player to score a direct free-kick for Southampton in the Premier League and first since James Ward-Prowse versus West Brom in February 2018.\n\nRomelu Lukaku's strike versus Southampton has ended a run of 12 games and 981 minutes without a goal for Manchester United in all competitions since netting against Watford in September.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nIt doesn't get any easier for Southampton, who travel to Wembley to take on Tottenham on Wednesday (20:00 GMT).

It was his lowest weight since his 2008 debut - a surprise given in recent weeks he made a point of stating his 214lbs mark in his last bout came after a dire camp during which he had been unwell.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport about his boxing return, Fury said: \"I don't remember a bigger comeback ever, someone coming from further away.\n\n\"I don't believe someone has gone up to 28 stone, lost all that weight, come back. I don't remember people suffering with all the problems I suffered with. So it ranks up there with the best comebacks of all time.\n\n\"The most important thing for me to do on Saturday is have fun. It's a great part of my life and I'll look back on it in time and think: do you know what, they were the best days of my life.\"\n\nThe bout will take place at around 04:30 BST on Sunday morning, with commentary on BBC Radio 5 live.\n\nBut is Fury fighting fit? Has his team given away a surprise tactic? And who are the BBC pundits picking? These are the talking points.\n\nFit, fighting fit and ring anxiety\n\nOne fighter's undefeated record is likely to end this weekend\n\nMore than one taxi driver has told BBC Sport's team in Los Angeles that they became aware of Fury upon reading of his 10st weight loss in around 12 months.\n\nBut his team plotted 18 months before a fight of such magnitude would be entertained, meaning he only has two routine wins to his name since June.\n\n\"You can spar or train but he hasn't been put under pressure,\" said former world middleweight champion Andy Lee, who will be part of BBC Radio 5 live's commentary team.\n\n\"He will have to deal with that internal anxiety moving around the ring, trying to slip, box and set himself. That's the biggest doubt.\"\n\nA ketogenic diet - boasting low carbohydrate intake - and countless 250kg deadlifts were features of Fury's transformation, but has he maintained the slick style which saw him beat Wladimir Klitschko to become a world champion in 2015?\n\n\"You only have to be half an inch wrong and the punches that were flying past your face are landing,\" said BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello. \"I've always felt there is a big difference between general fitness and boxing fitness.\"\n\nFury's trick to pick apart puncher\n\nAbel Sanchez believes that if Wilder connects with a big right hand, it is all over for Fury\n\nAmerican Wilder says he will administer a \"brutal knockout\" of his rival at the Staples Center - home of Los Angeles' NBA outfits the Lakers and Clippers.\n\nWith 39 knockouts from 40 bouts, the 33-year-old has power which makes him possibly the \"greatest puncher of all time\" according to Fury.\n\nAbel Sanchez - trainer of Gennady Glolovkin - will also be part of Radio 5 live's commentary team and believes \"there's not a man out there that can take a right hand from Deontay\".\n\nBut such power means Wilder's craft and pedigree as a 2008 Olympic bronze medallist has been \"all too easily dismissed\" according to Costello.\n\nThere are rumours Fury will switch from his preferred right-handed orthodox stance to southpaw - as he did against Dereck Chisora in 2014 - in order to flummox Wilder.\n\nDecorated trainer Freddie Roach, who Fury has hired as his cut man, told BBC Sport: \"I've watched two films of Wilder facing southpaws and he had trouble with both of them.\"\n\nBBC Radio 5 live analyst Steve Bunce added: \"Roach told me that when Fury switches to southpaw it's seamless, the opponents don't even realise.\"\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Tyson Fury: Losing his beard, Christmas pies and making love to the belt\n\nBeards and the 'Roach effect'\n\nThe presence of Roach in Fury's corner led to theories the challenger's 26-year-old trainer Ben Davison had been found wanting.\n\nRoach, who has trained the likes of Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan, welcomed Team Fury to his Wildcard Boxing Gym when they turned their backs on a camp at altitude after four weeks.\n\nCostello believes Roach's greatest impact will be felt way before the ring walks given his experience of fight night protocols in the US. Roach had even inquired as to what length Fury's beard could be before rules were broken, only for the fighter to shave it off.\n\n\"The Wilder camp see Roach as an act of desperation,\" said Costello.\n\n\"The most important role he could play is what happens at rules meetings, bandage wraps, those things. He is so familiar with what goes on in America.\n\n\"Officials may have made it difficult for a young British trainer like Davison but they will be unlikely to do so with Roach stood before them.\"\n\nLee, a former WBO world middleweight champion, added: \"The Roach thing is a very wise move. There's training and build-up but when it comes down to it and you're in the trenches you want to know you trust the man 100% beside you. So it's a huge night for Davison.\"\n\nPredictions\n\nMedia playback is not supported on this device Deontay Wilder v Tyson Fury: American fighter says Fury is 'terrified'\n\nCostello: Wilder. I just think the champion will find Fury in the second half of the fight.\n\nLee: This is one that can go any way but I will never doubt Fury and I am going for him on points.\n\nBunce: We will have a much better fight than anyone thinks. I can see Tyson in front and getting hurt. I arrived in LA thinking Tyson on points, now I have a dreadful feeling Wilder will find him, it may be late.\n\nSanchez: I've swayed both ways. It's 50-50.

We could end up with two Brits holding all four titles.\"\n\nCostello added: \"There is potentially a three-way rivalry building here. That would produce the best heavyweight rivalry for a quarter of a century when Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe were around.\n\n\"It is highly likely that the winner of this fight will - maybe after a rematch - be facing Anthony Joshua at some stage in 2019.\"\n\nBy around 06:00 GMT on Sunday morning the UK will know if Fury's incredible return includes a fairytale moment.

They were taller than us and stronger than us.\n\n\"In the last 20 minutes we were flat, we did not have the rhythm we needed. Winning that way, we suffered a lot in the first half, especially in the last 20 minutes. That is why I am delighted to win in that way.\"\n\nCity must hope Aguero absence is a short one\n\nThis is the start of a punishing six-week schedule that sees City play 13 games in the space of 44 days, including every midweek and weekend in December.\n\nSo it was perhaps not surprising that Guardiola chose to shuffle his squad, with five changes from the midweek draw with Lyon. Although the omission of Aguero was forced upon him.\n\nWith seven goals in his past 10 games, the Argentina striker has been in prolific form in recent weeks, and he was the player City missed more than most here.\n\nGuardiola revealed he might once again be without his leading striker for next Tuesday's match at Watford.\n\n\"I don't know if Aguero will be fit,\" the Spaniard said. \"We will see. I base my decisions on doctors, physios, instinct and what I see.\"\n\nBefore Saturday, City's attack had been even more lethal than the same stage last season, with more shots and shots on target than in 2017-18.\n\nBut their attacks were strangely short of an end product for almost an hour of this game, and the home crowd were beginning to voice their frustration until Sterling struck.\n\nBournemouth get their game-plan right\n\nBournemouth had been beaten heavily on each of their three previous visits to the Etihad, conceding a total of 13 goals.\n\nBut Cherries boss Eddie Howe did much better with his approach this time, with his side well organised at the back and frequently breaking forward dangerously too.\n\n\"I think it is the closest we have come [to matching Manchester City at the Etihad],\" Howe said.\n\n\"I don't know if it is the best we have performed. I still don't think we have fully delivered a performance that we are truly capable of here but think that is the closest we have come.\"\n\nThey had already got in some good positions without finding the right final ball when Wilson rose to power his header home, and continued to look dangerous with the score at 1-1.\n\nCity are the only Premier League team this season not to have dropped any points this season from winning positions, but that scenario looked a distinct possibility until Sterling struck.\n\nEven then, the Cherries did not crumble. Four successive defeats have taken the shine off Bournemouth's strong start to the season, but this performance should give them some belief that they can stay in the top half of the table.\n\n\"I think we limited them in terms of clear cut chances today and I think the goals came at bad times for us but don't think we looked too vulnerable,\" Howe added.\n\n\"Yes, they had a lot of the ball but it was in front of us and we were happy with that. But we had some good moments on the counter attack and a lot of opportunities from set-pieces.\n\n\"There were just a couple of moments that just went against us - it's the closest we have come.\"\n\nMan of the match - Leroy Sane (Man City)\n\nInvolved in two of City's three goals and only denied one himself by Asmir Begovic's superb late stop, the German winger's desire did not dip even when his side let Bournemouth back in the game.\n\nHis all-round action-packed display was epitomised by his dash back to dispossess Joshua King as the Cherries threatened on the break.\n\nWhat the managers said\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\n\"It was a good win. After the Champions League it is always tough. People think it's easy for us but that is not the truth, so I like to win in this way.\n\n\"We were flat but after we were more aggressive and we changed the game. I asked them for more at half-time but the first five minutes was no good, they didn't listen. But one action from Raheem Sterling changed the game.\n\n\"Leroy Sane was fantastic too. We don't expect every 90 minutes to have an incredible performance. Sometimes it happens. It is a lesson we have to learn, how to win when we are tired.\"\n\nBournemouth manager Eddie Howe, speaking to BBC Sport:\n\n\"We nullified them for long periods and had moments ourselves when the ball could have bounced our way. It was a good time to score, right on half-time.\n\n\"We haven't done enough defensively and weren't clinical enough in attack. We have an honest group of players and I can't fault them at all.\n\n\"The three goals we conceded were scrappy - they didn't cut through us with beautiful football and we kick ourselves for that.\n\n\"Our plan worked. We're frustrated because we had good counter-attacks - the ball just didn't bounce our way.

They symbolise an attitude which is in complete antithesis to the idea of an independent woman - signifying that the woman with the ring belongs to another person.\n\nThey are also a way of signifying status: the bigger the diamond, the greater apparent value they give to the woman wearing it.\n\nWhy did women only get one day to propose?\n\nAll of my friends here in the US disagree with me. Most of them have diamond engagement rings, some bigger than others. And they usually show them off on social media and when we meet up and make fun of me.\n\nAnd it's not just my generation who find my ideas odd - my daughter makes fun of me too.\n\nShe dreams of having a showy engagement ring. I try to understand her because I know it is part of the cultural context in which she was born, but I don't agree at all with that mentality.\n\nIn fact, the whole ritual of proposing marriage bothers me. The pantomime of a man kneeling down and asking for a woman's hand seems absurd to me. It puts her in a passive role, and asking her in a very public way - such as live on stage or in front of cameras - makes her even more vulnerable. It really is an eccentric act.\n\nMarrying someone is not just a romantic gesture - it is a mutual agreement. It has economic and legal implications.\n\nWhat is BBC 100 Women?\n\nBBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre.\n\nOne of our projects this year is the Freedom Trash Can.\n\nIn 1968 feminist protestors encouraged women to throw their \"items of oppression\" in the bin, so we'll be asking our audiences what they would throw away as women today.\n\nIf my ex-husbands had proposed I would have started laughing. But it never happened because it was more of a conversation - it was a mutual decision in both cases.\n\nAlthough women can of course take the lead and propose marriage themselves, it still rarely happens that way.\n\nImage copyright Matilde Suesc\u00fan Image caption Matilde was born in Colombia, where she says the culture is different\n\nI am concerned that society and the media seems to educate girls to dream, from when they are young, about the man who, to quote Beyonce, will \"Put a ring on it\". And those girls then grow up with this idea that married life will then solve all their problems.\n\nInstead of just aspiring to marriage and a ring, I think girls should aspire to be independent, to study and develop, to seek happiness for themselves.\n\nWhen I wrote something similar in my blog for El Tiempo, a newspaper in my native Colombia, readers called me a radical feminist and accused me of killing romance. But that is not true - I am a very romantic person. What I don't find romantic at all is waiting for a \"brave prince\" to come into my life with a ring.\n\nWhat I actually do find romantic is the idea that if I do get married at my age, it's simply a reflection of a profound commitment of loyalty and love to the other person.\n\nAs told to Luc\u00eda Blasco, BBC News Mundo\n\nSee who is on our 2018 BBC 100 Women list.\n\nFollow BBC 100 Women on Instagram and Facebook and join the conversation.\n\nRead more:"}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46405141", "published": "2018-12-01T02:56:46", "title": "Fighting South Korea's spy cam porn 'epidemic'", "text": "Video\n\nHidden cameras capture women undressing, going to the toilet, or even in changing rooms in South Korea.

Taking a second or even third wife is not uncommon in Afghanistan, and is sometimes done because they believe a new wife could mean a new chance to have a male child.\n\nWhen she refused, they suggested that my father swap me for a boy. They even found a family in the village who was willing to give their boy away and take me.\n\nSwapping children is not something that is part of our culture, and I haven't heard of it happening before, but boys are more valued in Afghan society as the traditional family breadwinners.\n\nImage copyright Nargis Taraki Image caption Nargis credits her father's support for her ability to get an education\n\nPeople deliberately said things to upset my mother and make her feel inferior for not having a son. Despite her refusal to part ways with me, some elders still kept approaching my father. But he had a completely different mentality. He told them he loved me, and he would one day prove to them that a daughter can achieve everything a son can.\n\nIt was not an easy time for my father. He had a military background and a history of service in the previous Soviet-backed regime, and my native district at the time was controlled by people with religious or fundamentalist tendencies.\n\nSo certain people in the village used to detest him and did not socialise with us.\n\nBut my father believed in what he said, and he always stood by his word. Although there was pressure on my parents to swap me because I was a girl, it was a man who had the most positive impact on my character.\n\nFleeing home\n\nThings got worse for us after Taliban militants took control of our district. In 1998 my father had to flee to Pakistan and soon after that we joined him there.\n\nLife there was not easy - but he managed to get work as a manager in a shoe factory. Perhaps the best thing to happen to my parents whilst in Pakistan was that they finally had a son, followed by my fifth sister.\n\nImage copyright Nargis Taraki Image caption Nargis (left) with one of her sisters and younger brother\n\nIn 2001, we all returned to Kabul after the Taliban regime was toppled. We didn't have a house of our own and had to live with my uncles. My sisters and I managed to keep going to school despite conservatism in our culture.\n\nI went on to study public policy and administration at Kabul University and graduated two years ago with the highest marks for that year. Throughout that time my father never stopped supporting me.\n\nA couple of years ago I went to watch a cricket game in Kabul with my sister. There weren't many women in the stadium and our photographs and videos were circulated on social media. People started criticising us and leaving negative comments, saying we were shameless to be in a stadium amongst men. Others said we were trying to spread adultery and were being paid by the Americans.\n\nWhen my father saw some of the comments on Facebook, he looked at me and said: \"My dear. You have done the right thing. I am glad you have annoyed some of these idiots. Life is short. Enjoy it as much as you can.\"\n\nMy father died of cancer earlier this year. In him, I lost someone whose constant support made me into the person that I am today, and I know he will always be with me.\n\nImage copyright Promote-WIE Image caption Nargis presenting a talk at a Forward Together Afghanistan event\n\nThree years ago I tried to open a school for girls in my native village in Ghazni. I talked to my father about it and he said it would be almost impossible because of cultural boundaries, and even boys have difficulties because of the security situation. My father thought giving it a name of a religious madrassa might have improved our chances.\n\nIn the end I was unable to travel to my native village because it was simply too dangerous. One of my sisters and I still hope to achieve this goal one day.\n\nIn the meantime, I volunteered for several years for NGOs in that part of the world, working for women's education, health and empowerment.\n\nI've also presented talks on a girl's right to go to school, university and to get a job.\n\nI've always dreamed of studying at the University of Oxford one day. When I look at international university rankings I always find Oxford in first or second position, and when I compare that with Kabul University I feel a bit sad - although that's not to say I'm not thankful I was able to go.\n\nImage copyright Promote-WIE Image caption Nargis has given talks on the importance of education\n\nI love to read in my spare time - an average of two to three books a week - and Paolo Coelho is my favourite author.\n\n'No compromise'\n\nIn terms of marriage, I would like to choose someone myself and my family have given me permission to marry someone of my own choice.\n\nIt would be great if I can find someone who has the same qualities as my father. I would want to spend the rest of my life with someone who has a similar attitude - who can support me and stand by my choices.\n\nFamily is also important - sometimes you marry the best man out there but then you cannot adapt to his family.\n\nThey will have to support me in what I want to do in my life. If they resist then I will try and change their minds.

Ultimately, the plan is for humans to be able to enter the contaminated cave.\n\n\"We'll need to look at novel decontamination agents to help us clean out the plant more effectively,\" says Melanie Brownridge, head of technology at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.\n\nThorp: A brief history\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Decontaminating Thorp: a job only robots can do\n\nThermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant - Thorp - first conceived in the 1970s\n\nCost \u00a31.8bn, started operating in 1994\n\nRecycled used fuel from advanced gas cooled reactors (AGRs), extracting uranium and plutonium\n\nThis extracted fuel would then be used in a new generation of super-efficient \"fast-breeder\" reactors that can \"burn\" plutonium\n\nBut fast breeders never found favour and Thorp underperformed\n\nProcessed 9,000 tonnes of used nuclear fuel in all, 40% from overseas\n\nGenerated revenues of \u00a39bn, says site operator Sellafield Ltd\n\nEnded operation November 2018\n\n\"That should help us remove more of the radioactivity early on, so that we can get on with the decommissioning job sooner.\"\n\nCleaning up other parts of the plant will also need robots and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs).\n\nSome will need to be developed from scratch, while others can be adapted from systems already used in other industries, such as oil and gas, car manufacturing and even the space sector.\n\n\"Some of these might be very small robots, able to change shape and go through small apertures into the facility,\" explains Ms Brownridge.\n\n\"Others might be quite large devices used as platforms to take technology inside - so there will be a whole range,\" she says.\n\nSellafield, and the engineering companies it works with, already have a great deal of experience developing technology for use in a highly radioactive environment.\n\nThe site in Cumbria contains a number of other redundant facilities, some dating back to the 1950s and many of them heavily contaminated, which are currently being decommissioned.\n\nA flying drone has been used to map radiation in inaccessible parts of the site, for example.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside the most dangerous parts of Sellafield\n\nRemote submarines have explored and begun cleaning up old storage ponds. Other remote machines are being used to take cameras deep inside decaying bunkers, filled with radioactive debris.\n\nThe job of developing machines like these is shared with a large network of specialist companies, many of them based in Cumbria itself. They form part of a growing decommissioning industry within the UK, as the country grapples with the legacy of its first era of nuclear power.\n\nThe NDA believes that these companies can use what they learn at Sellafield, and other plants, to attract further business from overseas.\n\nThe drone mentioned above, for example, was developed by radiation-mapping specialists Createc and UAV company Blue Bear.\n\nIt is is now being used inside a damaged reactor building at the Fukushima plant in Japan.\n\nImage copyright Createc/Blue Bear Image caption The Riser drone senses radiation levels in areas such as Fukushima in Japan\n\nIn this, the NDA has a surprising ally. The environment group Greenpeace, which bitterly opposed the opening of Thorp, is enthusiastic about decommissioning.\n\n\"We do feel it's important that Sellafield confronts the decommissioning challenges that arise from Thorp's closure,\" says the organisation's policy director, Doug Parr.\n\n\"In fact there's a good case that people there can become world experts and world leaders in the decommissioning of nuclear power stations and other installations.

If so, it's likely that they will not lose the accent so quickly.\"\n\nGetting ahead\n\nImage caption His accent has certainly not held back Calvin Harris in the music business\n\nThere can also be career reasons for trying to alter the way we speak - or not.\n\n\"Another reason is when their accent is not stopping them from being successful,\" Dr Jansen added.\n\n\"Often people from the north of England try to sound southern when they move down south because of certain stereotypes that exist.\n\n\"Usually, Scottish English is associated with positive things and people in the US won't be able to identify that Calvin Harris is from Dumfries.\n\n\"He does not seem to have to tone down his accent to be understood by Americans and other native and non-native English speakers, this might play a role as well.\"\n\nThat is a view echoed by Dr Dominic Watt, senior lecturer in the department of language and linguistic science at the University of York.\n\n\"In some cases, people retain their accents because they don't feel any need to change them,\" he said.\n\n\"If the accent isn't stigmatised by anyone, and it doesn't seem to cause any comprehension issues, there's no pressure to modify it.\n\n\"People may even find that their accent is a boon because it's thought attractive in the new place.\"\n\nAge factor\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The age that you leave an area is \"extremely important\" in terms of accent\n\nBut what about people who do pick up an accent when they move away?\n\n\"Some people do pick up accents easier than others,\" Dr Jansen said.\n\n\"However, most people will adopt some features from the place they've moved to after a while.\"\n\nAccording to Prof Monika Schmid, head of the department of language and linguistics at the University of Essex, there are a number of reasons people pick up a new accent.\n\n\"I would argue very strongly that it is definitely not an affectation,\" she said.\n\n\"My hunch would be that it is mainly people who are - or would be - good at learning other languages who tend to pick up new accents.\n\n\"But there is probably also a lot there that has to do with issues of identity and, of course, the age at which you leave the area of origin is extremely important.\n\n\"If this is before puberty, the language or dialect is still very unstable and can be lost extremely quickly.\"\n\nDr Watt agreed age was a significant factor.\n\n\"There seems to be a cut-off round about age 10 to 11, after which it's really difficult to acquire the new accent in all its fine detail,\" he said.\n\n'Dial it back'\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Experts say it would not be easy to maintain a \"put on\" accent when speaking casually and informally\n\nHowever, he said that regardless of a speaker's age if there were \"strong pressures to conform\" in order to fit in then they might modify their accent - as he himself has done.\n\n\"I grew up in Edinburgh and lived in Aberdeenshire for several years before I moved here to York,\" he said.\n\n\"People now tell me there isn't much of a trace of a Scottish accent left in my speech, which isn't really true, but I imagine that I've dialled back on some of the pronunciations I would have used when living up in north east Scotland.\"\n\nProf Schmid said she would \"very much doubt\" many people could \"put on\" an accent for any length of time without it slipping.\n\n\"Putting on an accent requires monitoring yourself at a level that we do not normally do when we speak casually and informally,\" she explained.\n\n\"If the accent persists in such situations then it would be more natural to assume that the person's normal way of speaking has simply changed.\"\n\nAlthough, she stressed, that did not mean they would be unable to slip back to their old accent.\n\nAccent shifters\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Dr Jansen said the musician sounded more Scottish when talking about Scotland\n\nDr Jansen said people might switch between accents depending who they are speaking to or the situation they are in.\n\n\"I've met lots of people who've had elocution lessons, especially northerners,\" she said.\n\n\"They are often perceived as 'posh' by others.\n\n\"However, in situations where people can't monitor themselves so much - for example in an emotional situation or when they are tired - they slip back into a broader accent.\n\n\"Mobile speakers might change parts of their accent depending on the situation,\" she added.\n\n\"Calvin Harris seems to sound more Scottish when he talks about Scotland but less Scottish when he talks about his successes.\"\n\nSo, it appears, the original question about accent is a complicated one to answer.\n\nIt depends on age, identity, pressures to conform and a range of other factors.\n\nAnd, even for the Dumfries DJ it seems, it can still be affected by who he is speaking to and what is being discussed."}, {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46287094", "published": "2018-11-27T00:15:01", "title": "Indonesia tsunami: 'It\u2019s an absolute miracle' my child survived", "text": "When a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, hundreds of children were separated from their parents.

We have shared just some of those cases. There are many more where the motives were unclear, or the perpetrators unidentified.\n\nThe new UNODC report suggests that a large share of violence against women is \"widely underreported to authorities and that a large share of such violence is hidden\".\n\nRebecca Skippage, who led the project for BBC Monitoring, found that behind the numbers, \"the way in which the media reported their lives and deaths revealed a huge amount about how women are viewed by different societies around the world\".\n\nShe explains: \"We were looking for deaths within one day, but we searched for that day's stories for a month. We found that the time-lag in reporting, the tone of the coverage or the scarcity of information often told a wider tale about the status of women in that region.\"\n\nMaryam Azwer works for BBC Monitoring and drew much of the final data together.\n\n\"This is as much about the deaths that aren't reported, as those that are,\" she says.\n\n\"Those whose stories never reached the media, that went unreported, were unverified, or were not or could not be investigated.

But like hundreds of others, they were told to wait\n\nAs thousands of migrants from Central America try to reach the US to seek asylum, many others are already waiting for a chance to cross the border from Mexico, the first step of an unpredictable and often traumatic process.\n\nOn a cold morning this month, Rogerio Baltazar and his family arrived in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, in northern Mexico, carrying only two old school backpacks where they had put the few things that were now everything they had - some pieces of light clothing that would do little to keep them warm and, certainly of more value, documents to prove who they said they were.\n\nThey had left their tiny village in rural Guatemala two weeks earlier, risking it all in a perilous journey by bus, sometimes even on foot, and were clearly not prepared for the weather or almost everything else they found here.\n\nRogerio, the 30-year-old leading the four, was tired, longing for a shower, and a better coat, too. But that could wait. What really mattered was to keep going, one last time, cross the bridge over the Rio Grande, so close, and finally reach the United States. He planned to seek asylum there and with Cristina, his 20-year-old wife, and two sons, aged four and two, have another chance in life.\n\nHe did not know a word of English - in fact, he could barely read Spanish - or the name of a single city in the country he was desperate to get to. But \"Si Dios quiere\"(God willing) everything, miraculously, would work in their favour. \"It's a dream,\" he said, \"for my family, my sons\". They had come a long way and nothing would stop them. Yet the four were not going anywhere.\n\nImage caption Migrants were being given numbers so they did not have to queue to cross from Ju\u00e1rez\n\nThings at the border were so uncertain that, every morning, the staff of Casa del Migrante, a Catholic Church-run shelter in Ju\u00e1rez, searched the region's newspapers for reports about immigration. The most relevant were attached to a large mural in the always busy reception, next to posters explaining basic rights of asylum seekers which had been framed and permanently fixed on the wall.\n\nAs the Baltazars travelled through Mexico, they were told to stop there for a rest in safety, a decent meal and information they could trust. Ju\u00e1rez, a dusty town opposite El Paso, in Texas, has become used - and annoyed - by the constant flow of people marching north, quite often a source of trouble. \"Santa Fe bridge is closed again\", read a headline from El Diario, a local daily, displayed in the shelter. Every day seemed to bring something new.\n\nFor some time, the Trump administration - which is trying to respond to thousands of Central American migrants who are at the border with California - has claimed the system is overwhelmed and that officials are unable to process all requests. As a result, it has limited the number of asylum seekers being allowed in, turning many away. (Some activists, however, dispute this, often saying it is a manufactured crisis.)\n\nImage caption For Baltazar, one of the reasons for his quest for America was his sons: \"I want them to have something\"\n\nHaving no smartphone or portable radio, Baltazar seemed lost. \"I don't know anything about Trump,\" he calmly said, \"what he thinks, nothing\". Barred from setting up camp next to the crossings, the migrants received a number by Red Cross workers indicating their place in the queue and told to wait.\n\nWorkers at Casa del Migrante said the process during the Obama years was incredibly slow at times, but that people were not systematically prevented from crossing. It was frustrating, said Baltazar, who carried his number, 540, annotated by marker pen on his right forearm.\n\nHis next step, seeking asylum, was unlikely to be any easier. Like everyone else, he would have to prove fear of persecution or torture, a procedure known as credible fear. Those unable to understand English depend on translators who, at many times, are not even there. Help then comes through phone's speakers.\n\nApplicants, meanwhile, remain detained - families are expected to be kept together - until an answer is given, generally within two weeks. Between October 2016 and September 2017, 75% of the 79,710 screenings turned out positive.\n\nRead more on Trump and immigration\n\nThe claims deemed reasonable are then referred to immigration courts. In theory, the asylum seekers are released and allowed to temporarily live in the US, often wearing electronic ankles. But people have been detained for longer, sometimes in harsh conditions, contributing to mental and physical health problems in many cases. (The Trump administration wants individuals to wait for a decision in Mexico, and not in the US.)\n\nWhat comes next is a years-long wait. By March 2018, people who were given asylum had waited, on average, more than 1,000 days while there were 318,624 cases pending a decision. Some advocates say this a system seemingly designed to make people give up. If the credible fear is rejected, migrants are ordered to be removed but can try a complicated review before they are deported.\n\nBaltazar had no idea when his turn would come. Having to stay at the shelter, he spent the night with more than 200 other men and women, of all ages, who had arrived before him with a similar goal. He feared it could be days, if not weeks, before his number was called.\n\nImage caption Baltazar said he was attacked by a group of men in 2015 who cut a small part of his ear with a knife\n\nIn 2015, as Baltazar walked on an empty street of his poor village in Guatemala at night, he said five masked men attacked him with a knife, cutting out a small part of the top of his right ear. They did not take anything from him - Baltazar said he did not have anything for them to rob anyway - and, to this day, he knew nothing about who had done it and why.\n\nThe men quickly escaped in the dark and Baltazar did not find anyone around to ask for help. Bleeding, he ran back home where his wife improvised a way to treat the injury. It eventually healed but left a scar that he tried to hide with his shiny dark hair.\n\nThe days that followed, Baltazar recalled, had his family locked indoors, terrified that the attackers could be looking for them. Guatemala is one of the deadliest, and poorest, countries in Central America, with crime fuelled by gangs and organised groups. (It is nowhere as violent as its Northern Triangle neighbours, Honduras and El Salvador, where extraordinarily high murder rates have forced thousands of residents to leave year after year.)\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown\n\nBut Baltazar had no option other than \"seguir adelante\", carry on. While his wife took care of their then only son, he said he spent most of the time looking for work. Any work. When luck was on his side, he found something, usually helping at a construction site or plantation field, earning him a few, but much needed, Guatemalan quetzal.\n\nThe couple, together since 2013, had a second son in 2016, adding to the pressure. \"We didn't have anything,\" he said. \"Sometimes you eat, sometimes you don't... No one can live this way.\"\n\nThen last October, Baltazar said unknown men tried, again, to attack him. This time, he protected his head with his arms and the suspects walked away without harming him. (From Ju\u00e1rez it was almost impossible to independently verify his version of events.) He no longer felt safe there. \"I don't know what they wanted,\" Baltazar said. It was easy to convince his wife that they had to go. \"They'd have killed me if I had stayed.\"\n\nImage caption Most of the migrants are devoted Christians and believe that a divine force will help them\n\nAt Casa del Migrante, for their security, Baltazar and the others were not allowed to venture outside - the shelter was some nine miles (15km) from the Paso del Norte (or Santa Fe) bridge they planned to cross. Many knew someone - a relative, a neighbour, a friend of a friend - who had made it into the US successfully, one way or another. What they heard back from America gave them some hope, at least.\n\nFor Baltazar it was his brother, who had crossed years earlier to never return - he did not explain how or his current situation. In the few times they had spoken on the phone, Baltazar was encouraged to get his family to the border and seek asylum if anything ever happened to them. Baltazar was not sure how it all worked but talked with confidence that they would be taken in, virtually a fait accompli. \"They say there's work there... I want my boys to have something.\"\n\nPresident Trump says the system is being abused. Earlier this month, he ordered a ban on asylum applications from those crossing the border illegally, a decision a federal judge blocked last week, saying it was an \"extreme departure\" from prior practice. (In the run-up to the mid-term elections, Mr Trump said the thousands of migrants travelling to the US represented an invasion and that criminals were among them.)\n\nMany Trump supporters defend tougher policies to prevent bogus claims as officials say a large number of requests actually come from economic migrants who do not qualify for asylum. And as tensions mounted after migrants attempted to storm the border over the weekend, the president threatened to close permanently all crossings. (US border officers fired tear gas to repel migrants who, they said, were throwing rocks; MSNBC described it as a \"border battle\".)\n\nImage caption Part of the US-Mexico fence in El Paso, Texas: some fear tougher policies could actually result in more people trying to cross illegally\n\nWhen Baltazar was not helping his wife keep their children busy, usually by walking around the shelter's outdoor patio or playing with empty Coca-Cola bottles, he sat under the trees with other migrants, sharing stories that were invariably a mixture of never-ending misery and fear fuelled by rampant crime in their countries. It gave him, and probably the rest, a sense that everybody, in a way, was in this together.\n\nBut it also fed his anxiety. He watched with particular interest a man who had come days earlier, alone, Baltazar said, and did not even have a number to wait for. (When I visited Baltazar on a second day and his name was announced in the shelter's loudspeaker, I saw his frustration when he was told that it was just the reporter who had come to talk to him.)\n\nCritics argue stronger measures are unlikely to stop asylum seekers from showing up at the border, and say that, in fact, it could result in more people trying to cross it illegally, at greater danger. Workers at Casa del Migrante said they had sheltered a woman and her young son who had been caught by officials at the border days before Baltazar arrived.\n\nLike most migrants, Baltazar, who was slim and talked slowly with a low voice, was a devoted Christian and believed that a divine force would protect them. He and his wife had survived a \"difficult trip\" of exhausting hot days with scarce food, carrying their sons who understood nothing of what they were going through. But God, Baltazar said, \"knew everything\".\n\nImage caption The Trump administration says asylum seekers are being turned away because the system is overwhelmed, a claim disputed by activists\n\nFour days after Baltazar arrived in Ju\u00e1rez, he stopped replying to my text messages and calls went straight to his voice mail. His 540 had been called, Casa del Migrante later confirmed, much earlier than he expected. (They did not have any other information on him.)\n\nWhen we met for the first time, he said he was not worried about would happen to him once he crossed the border. \"I'm scared of having to return. If I'm not allowed in, I'll try again. In my city I'll never live again.\"\n\nFollow Hugo on Twitter: @hugobachega"}]}}}
