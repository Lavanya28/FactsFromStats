Scraping
The goal was to build a scraper that would fetch us news articles from several news sources alongside relevant links, author names, etc. The challenge here was to build a generic parser that would scrape relevant data from different news websites with different design interfaces. The scraper for article curation and scraping was built using a combination of python's Beautiful soup library and Newspaper3k. We picked these libraries for our work because it provides us with a range of features useful for the tool like Multi-threaded article download framework, News url identification and Author extraction from text. These libraries also provided us with a convenient way to add new websites for scraping through the json format. RSS version of links provided us with more consistent data and whenever it was available for a website we used the RSS links for scraping. To get consistent data and avoid fetching unnecessary content we used filtering mechanisms like checking published date.
